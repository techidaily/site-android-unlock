To learn how to set up a lock screen pattern on an Android device, simply follow these steps:</p><ul><li>1. Firstly, unlock your device and go to its Settings. You can access it from the Home Screen or from its Notification Center.</li><li>2. Under the personal or privacy section, you can access the “Lock Screen and Security” option.</li><li>3. In some versions, the option is also listed right at the top of the settings (in its quick access).</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/09/15057378431872.jpg"                      alt="setup android pattern lock screen-unlock your device"                > <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/09/15057378838236.jpg"                      alt="setup android pattern lock screen-Under the personal or privacy section"                > <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/09/15057379016188.jpg"                      alt="setup android pattern lock screen-access Lock Screen and Security"                ></p><ul><li>4. To set up a pattern lock screen, tap on the “Screen lock type” feature.</li><li>5. This will provide a list of all the different kinds of locks that you can apply. Ideally, it would be password, pin, pattern, swipe, or none. In “Swipe”, you can unlock a device just by swiping the screen. Whereas, in pattern, pin, or password, you would be needed to provide the respective pattern&#x2F;pin&#x2F;password to unlock the Lava Blaze 2 5G device.</li><li>6.

Make sure that you draw the same pattern here.</li><li>9. Additionally, the interface will ask you to provide a security pin as well.

Read on and learn how to set up a strong pattern lock screen on your device and what to do if you have forgotten it.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-set-up-Pattern-Lock-Screen-on-Lava-Yuva-2"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-set-up-Pattern-Lock-Screen-on-Lava-Yuva-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to set up Pattern Lock Screen on Lava Yuva 2?"></a>Part 1: How to set up Pattern Lock Screen on Lava Yuva 2?</h2><p>Out of all the provided options for screen locks, pattern lock is mostly used due to its ease of access and added security. If you haven’t set up a screen lock pattern on your device, then we recommend you to do the same right away. Not only will it keep intruders away, it will also protect your privacy. To learn how to set up a lock screen pattern on an Android device, simply follow these steps:</p><ul><li>1. Firstly, unlock your device and go to its Settings. You can access it from the Home Screen or from its Notification Center.</li><li>2. Under the personal or privacy section, you can access the “Lock Screen and Security” option.</li><li>3. In some versions, the option is also listed right at the top of the settings (in its quick access).</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/09/15057378431872.jpg"                      alt="setup android pattern lock screen-unlock your device"                > <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/09/15057378838236.jpg"                      alt="setup android pattern lock screen-Under the personal or privacy section"                > <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/09/15057379016188.jpg"                      alt="setup android pattern lock screen-access Lock Screen and Security"                ></p><ul><li>4. To set up a pattern lock screen, tap on the “Screen lock type” feature.</li><li>5. This will provide a list of all the different kinds of locks that you can apply. Ideally, it would be password, pin, pattern, swipe, or none. In “Swipe”, you can unlock a device just by swiping the screen. Whereas, in pattern, pin, or password, you would be needed to provide the respective pattern&#x2F;pin&#x2F;password to unlock the Lava Yuva 2 device.</li><li>6. We recommend setting up a lock screen pattern instead. To do this, tap on the “Pattern” option.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/09/15057379466607.jpg"                      alt="setup android pattern lock screen-tap on the “Screen lock type” feature"                > <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/15057379692063.jpg"                      alt="setup android pattern lock screen- provide the respective pattern"                > <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/09/15057379835226.jpg"                      alt="setup android pattern lock screen-tap on the “Pattern” option"                ></p><ul><li>7. From the next screen, you can simply draw any kind of pattern of your choice. Ideally, it should join at least 4 dots on the screen. We recommend using a strong screen lock pattern to provide unmatched security to your device.</li><li>8. Furthermore, you need to confirm your choice and provide the same pattern once again. Make sure that you draw the same pattern here.</li><li>9. Additionally, the interface will ask you to provide a security pin as well. In case if you will forget your pattern, then you can access your phone by taking the assistance of this pin.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/09/15057380143598.jpg"                      alt="setup android pattern lock screen"                > <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/09/15057380317550.jpg"                      alt="setup android pattern lock screen-provide the same pattern"                > <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/09/15057380506350.jpg"                      alt="setup android pattern lock screen-provide a security pin"                ></p><ul><li>10. Similarly, you would be required to confirm the pin as well to finish the setup.</li><li>11. That’s it! By completing these steps, a screen lock pattern will be implemented on your device.</li></ul><p>Later, you can follow the same drill to change your device’s lock screen pattern as well. Though, you would be needed to provide the existing pattern to access these features. Out of all the lock screen options, you should go with the pattern lock. Not only it is the most accessible option, it also provides fast results with an added security.</p><h2 id="Part-2-What-to-do-if-you-forget-Android-pattern-lock"><a href="#Part-2-What-to-do-if-you-forget-Android-pattern-lock" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: What to do if you forget Android pattern lock?"></a>Part 2: What to do if you forget Android pattern lock?</h2><p>After following the above-mentioned tutorial, you would be able to set up a pattern lock screen on your device.

This measure is implemented to guarantee that the Vivo Y17s device exclusively functions with the services provided by that specific carrier. If you wish to remove the operator lock from your Vivo Y17s  device, you’ll need to follow specific steps and meet certain criteria. Here’s how to remove the operator lock on a Vivo Y17s :</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Begin by checking whether your device can be unlocked or not from its network carrier restrictions. To do that, you need to dial the code “*#*#7378423#*#*” on your device, tap “Service Info” and select “SIM Lock.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/10/unlock-sony-xperia-pin-code-5.jpg"                      alt="dial the provided number"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Carefully check the information provided on the screen. If there is “X” before the “Network” option and the number in front of it is larger than 0, it means your device can be unlocked.

There are really just a few Apps on your Android device that have sensitive information you don’t want others getting access to. It would really be great if you could lock those apps individually as opposed to locking the Lava Storm 5G device as a whole.</p><p>Well, in light of helping you out, this article will address just how you can lock Apps on your device and not have to type in a code every time you want to use the Lava Storm 5G device.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Part-1-Why-you-need-to-Lock-Apps-on-Android"><a href="#Part-1-Why-you-need-to-Lock-Apps-on-Android" class="headerlink" title="Part 1.

Locking certain apps will allow you to easily access the Lava Storm 5G device and use it without having to remember passwords and patterns.</li><li>If you are a person who is not good at remembering passwords or patterns, simply locking certain apps will help you not get locked out of your entire device which can cause a lot of problems.</li><li>If your device is used by more than one person, locking certain apps will keep the other users out of information you would rather they didn’t access.</li><li>If you have children, you can eliminate the many accidental in-app purchases by locking the apps your children shouldn’t be on.</li><li>Locking apps is also a good way to keep children from content they shouldn’t be accessing.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Lock-Apps-in-Android"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Lock-Apps-in-Android" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. How to Lock Apps in Android"></a>Part 2. How to Lock Apps in Android</h2><p>There is always a good reason to Lock Apps on your device and we have two easy and effective methods you can use to do this. Choose the one that you are most comfortable with.</p><h3 id="Method-One-Using-Smart-App-Protector"><a href="#Method-One-Using-Smart-App-Protector" class="headerlink" title="Method One: Using Smart App Protector"></a>Method One: Using Smart App Protector</h3><p>Smart App Protector is a freeware that allows you to lock specified applications.</p><p>Step 1: Download and Install Smart App Protector from the Google Play Store and Launch it. You may be required to install a helper application for Smart App Protector. This helper will ensure that the many App services running on your device will not be killed by third party apps.</p><p>Step 2: The default password 7777 but you can change this in the Password &amp; Pattern Settings.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/android-lock-apps-01.jpg"                      alt="lock app on android"                ></p><p>Step 3: The next step is to add apps to the Smart App Protector. Open the Running Tab on Smart Protector and tap on the “Add” button.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/android-lock-apps-02.jpg"                      alt="lock app on android"                ></p><p>Step 3: Next, select the apps you would like to protect from the pop up list. Tap on the “Add” button once you have chosen your Apps.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/android-lock-apps-03.jpg"                      alt="lock app on android"                ></p><p>Step 4: Now close the app and the Apps chosen will now be password protected.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/android-lock-apps-04.jpg"                      alt="lock app on android"                ></p><h3 id="Method-2-Using-Hexlock"><a href="#Method-2-Using-Hexlock" class="headerlink" title="Method 2: Using Hexlock"></a>Method 2: Using Hexlock</h3><p>Step 1: Download Hexlock from the Google Play Store. Once it is installed, open it. You will be required to enter a pattern or PIN. This is the lock code that you will use every time you open the app.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/android-lock-apps-05.png"                      alt="lock app on android"                ></p><p>Step 2: Once the PIN or Password is set, you are now ready to lock apps.

The following are some of the apps you would like to lock for one reason or another.</p><h3 id="1-The-Messaging-App"><a href="#1-The-Messaging-App" class="headerlink" title="1. The Messaging App"></a>1. The Messaging App</h3><p>This is the application that allows you to send and receive messages. You may want to lock this app if you use your device to send messages of a sensitive nature that you would rather keep private. You may also want to lock this app if your device is used by more than one person and you don’t want other users reading your messages.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/android-lock-apps-08.jpg"                      alt="lock app on android"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2123750/7443" target="_top" id="2123750">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2123750" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2123750/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="2-Email-App"><a href="#2-Email-App" class="headerlink" title="2. Email App"></a>2. Email App</h3><p>Most people use individual email applications such as Yahoo Mail App or Gmail. This is another critical one if you are going to protect your work emails. You may want to lock the email app if your work emails are sensitive in nature and contain information that is not for all individuals.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/android-lock-apps-09.jpg"                      alt="lock app on android"                ></p><h3 id="3-Google-Play-Services"><a href="#3-Google-Play-Services" class="headerlink" title="3. Google Play Services"></a>3. Google Play Services</h3><p>This is the application that allows you to download and install applications to your device. You may want to lock this one if you are trying to prevent other users from downloading and installing further apps to your device. This is especially valuable if your device is utilized by children.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/android-lock-apps-10.jpg"                      alt="lock app on android"                ></p><h3 id="4-Gallery-App"><a href="#4-Gallery-App" class="headerlink" title="4. Gallery App"></a>4. Gallery App</h3><p>The Gallery app displays all the images on your device. The main reason you may want to lock the Gallery app may be because you have sensitive images that are not suitable for all viewers. Again this is ideal if children make use of your device and you have images that you would rather they didn’t see.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/android-lock-apps-11.jpg"                      alt="lock app on android"                ></p><h3 id="5-Music-Pla-x-yer-App"><a href="#5-Music-Pla-x-yer-App" class="headerlink" title="5.

It is the ultimate app to lock if you have sensitive information on your device that you would rather not share. Locking this app will ensure that all of the files on your device will remain safe from prying eyes.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/android-lock-apps-13.jpg"                      alt="lock app on android"                ></p><p>Having the ability to lock your Apps is an easy way to keep information out of the limelight.

This allows users to customize their devices extensively. However, despite this openness, certain features and capabilities can still be locked or restricted, either by Google or the Motorola Moto G14 device manufacturer.</p><p>For those looking to truly unleash the full potential of their Android device, an OEM unlock is an essential step. This article will delve into the process of <strong>OEM unlocking on Android</strong>, guiding you through its benefits and how to safely perform it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/what-is-oem-unlock-01.jpg"                      alt="android phone with padlock"                ></p><p><strong>OEM lock</strong> might sound like technical jargon to many. However, it’s a key concept for those who wish to dive deeper into Android customization. OEM stands for Original Equipment Manufacturer. Unlocking in this context refers to removing restrictions made by the manufacturer on the Motorola Moto G14 device.</p><p>This process allows you to gain deeper access to the Motorola Moto G14 device’s software. Thus, OEM unlocking is often required for customizing or modifying the system at a more advanced level.</p><h3 id="Why-Enable-OEM-Unlock"><a href="#Why-Enable-OEM-Unlock" class="headerlink" title="Why Enable OEM Unlock?"></a>Why Enable OEM Unlock?</h3><p>The primary reason to enable <strong>OEM unlocking</strong> is to gain the ability to root your device or install custom firmware, also known as ROMs. Rooting is the Android equivalent of jailbreaking. It allows users to access and modify the Motorola Moto G14 device’s software at the deepest level.</p><p>This can enable the installation of apps and software that require more permissions than what is typically available. On the other hand, custom ROMs can change your device’s interface. They can also add features not available in the stock version of Android.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/what-is-oem-unlock-02.jpg"                      alt="android oem unlocking settings"                ></p><h3 id="Pros-and-Cons-of-OEM-Unlocking"><a href="#Pros-and-Cons-of-OEM-Unlocking" class="headerlink" title="Pros and Cons of OEM Unlocking"></a>Pros and Cons of OEM Unlocking</h3><p>Here are some great things you can get when you <strong>allow OEM unlock.</strong></p><ul><li>The most significant advantage is the ability to customize your device far beyond what’s possible with standard settings.</li><li><strong>Root access.</strong> It allows for rooting the phone enabling advanced features and apps.</li><li><strong>Custom ROMs.</strong> Users can install different versions of Android or entirely new operating systems.</li></ul><p>On the other hand, here are some cons that you must consider before performing the process on your phone:</p><ul><li><strong>Security risks.</strong> Root access can make your device more vulnerable to malware and hacking.</li><li><strong>Void warranty.</strong> OEM unlocking often voids the manufacturer’s warranty.</li><li><strong>Potential for bricking.</strong> Incorrect procedures can render the Motorola Moto G14 device unusable, known as ‘bricking’.</li></ul><h3 id="Understanding-the-Risks"><a href="#Understanding-the-Risks" class="headerlink" title="Understanding the Risks"></a>Understanding the Risks</h3><p>It’s crucial to understand that OEM unlocking is not without its risks. It does open the door to several customizations and tweaks. However, it can also compromise the security of your device. There’s always a chance of bricking your phone, especially if the unlocking process isn’t followed correctly or an unstable custom ROM is installed.</p><p>Additionally, most manufacturers will void your warranty once you unlock the bootloader. This leaves you without support in case something goes wrong. So, in the next sections, you’ll be guided through the steps of OEM unlocking. You’ll also learn how to do it safely, ensuring you make the most out of your Android device.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-To-Enable-OEM-Unlock-on-Your-Android-Phone"><a href="#Part-2-How-To-Enable-OEM-Unlock-on-Your-Android-Phone" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How To Enable OEM Unlock on Your Android Phone"></a>Part 2: How To Enable OEM Unlock on Your Android Phone</h2><p><strong>Enabling OEM unlock</strong> can feel like stepping into uncharted territory. Still, it’s relatively straightforward if you follow the right steps. Before you start, it’s important to remember that the exact process can vary slightly depending on your device’s brand and model. However, the general steps are usually similar across most Android devices.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/what-is-oem-unlock-03.jpg"                      alt="android developer options"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Before proceeding, ensure you <a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/backup/android-backup-software.html"><u>back up all important data</u></a>.

Then, tap on the Build number seven times. You should see a message that says you’re now a developer.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Find and select Developer options on Settings. Then, tap <strong>OEM unlocking</strong>.

It allows you to customize your device beyond what’s available in its factory settings. This newfound freedom, however, comes with its own set of responsibilities and risks. Here’s what you can do after having your phone <strong>OEM unlocked</strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/what-is-oem-unlock-04.jpg"                      alt="android custom roms"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2137380/7443" target="_top" id="2137380">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2137380" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2137380/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Root-Your-Device"><a href="#Root-Your-Device" class="headerlink" title="Root Your Device"></a>Root Your Device</h3><p>Rooting is akin to having the master key to your device’s software. It allows you to gain superuser access, enabling modifications and access to system files that were previously restricted. With rooting, you can:</p><ul><li>Remove pre-installed apps or bloatware.</li><li>Customize system settings and UI elements.</li><li>Enhance performance or battery life through underclocking or overclocking the CPU.</li></ul><h3 id="Flash-a-Custom-ROM"><a href="#Flash-a-Custom-ROM" class="headerlink" title="Flash a Custom ROM"></a>Flash a Custom ROM</h3><p>A custom ROM is a new operating system you can install on your device. This is one of the most popular reasons for OEM unlocking. Custom ROMs offer:</p><ul><li>The latest Android updates, even for older devices, are no longer supported by manufacturers.</li><li>New features and customization options that aren’t available in the stock ROM.</li><li>Potential performance improvements and unique user interfaces.</li></ul><h3 id="Enjoy-High-Customization"><a href="#Enjoy-High-Customization" class="headerlink" title="Enjoy High Customization"></a>Enjoy High Customization</h3><p>With an OEM unlocked device, the sky’s the limit regarding customization. You can:</p><ul><li>Install custom kernels for better performance and battery life.</li><li>Use powerful apps that require root access for advanced device management.</li><li>Customize everything from the boot animation to the layout of your UI.</li></ul><p>However, it’s crucial to proceed with caution. Rooting and installing custom ROMs can void your warranty and, if not done correctly, can turn your device into an expensive paperweight (a state often referred to as “bricking”). Always use reliable sources for your custom ROMs and root-access apps.</p><h2 id="Bonus-How-To-Unlock-Your-Android-Screen-When-You-Forgot-Password"><a href="#Bonus-How-To-Unlock-Your-Android-Screen-When-You-Forgot-Password" class="headerlink" title="Bonus: How To Unlock Your Android Screen When You Forgot Password"></a>Bonus: How To Unlock Your Android Screen When You Forgot Password</h2><p><a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/guide-to-unlock-mi-account-without-password.html"><u>Forgetting the password </u></a> to your Android phone can be a stressful experience.

This application is readily available on most recent mobile phone models, especially those operating on Android 6.0 and newer versions.</p><p>Although you can no longer use the <strong>Google Assistant unlock</strong> feature, you can still perform a myriad of tasks using Google Assistant. These include:</p><ul><li>Getting the weather</li><li>Setting alarms</li><li>Playing music</li><li>Sending texts</li><li>Making a call</li><li>Asking Google for information, etc.</li></ul><h3 id="Enable-Google-Assistant-on-Lock-Screen-A-Step-by-Step-Guide"><a href="#Enable-Google-Assistant-on-Lock-Screen-A-Step-by-Step-Guide" class="headerlink" title="Enable Google Assistant on Lock Screen: A Step-by-Step Guide"></a>Enable Google Assistant on Lock Screen: A Step-by-Step Guide</h3><p>Now that you’re eager to try the potential of Google Assistant on your lock screen, let’s walk through the simple steps on how to enable this tool.</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open Google Assistant:</li></ul><p>Look for “Google Assistant” and open the app.</p><ul><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Ask Google Assistant to open the settings.</li></ul><p>You can ask, “Hey Google, open the Google Assistant settings,” and it will show you the Google Assistant settings.</p><ul><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Allow Google Assistant on the lock screen.</li></ul><p>Locate the “Lock Screen” settings and make sure to switch on “Assistant responses on lock screen.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/unlock-phone-with-voice-google-assistant-2.jpg"                      alt="Enable Google Assistant on the lock screen"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-To-Use-Google-Assistant-on-Lock-Screen"><a href="#Part-2-How-To-Use-Google-Assistant-on-Lock-Screen" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

You can do this by saying the wake word “Hey Google” or “OK Google.” If it doesn’t work, you can long-press the home button or use any dedicated gesture to activate Google Assistant.</p><ul><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Issue a Voice Command</li></ul><p>Once Google Assistant is active, issue a voice command related to the task you want to perform. For example:</p><p>“Hey Google, what’s the weather today?”</p><p>“OK Google, set an alarm for 5 PM.”</p><p>“Hey Google, play my Spotify playlist.”</p><p>When you can still <strong>unlock with Google Assistant</strong>, you can ask it to “unlock my phone” or use any similar command.</p><ul><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Interact with Responses</li></ul><p>Google Assistant will then provide spoken responses and display relevant information on the lock screen. For instance, if you ask for the weather, it might verbally provide the current conditions and display a brief summary on your lock screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/unlock-phone-with-voice-google-assistant-3.jpg"                      alt="Using Google Assistant on the lock screen"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-Common-Problems-When-Using-Google-Assistant"><a href="#Part-3-Common-Problems-When-Using-Google-Assistant" class="headerlink" title="Part 3.

Common Problems When Using Google Assistant</h2><p>Unable to use <strong>Google Assistant to unlock phone</strong> is not the only drawback that users may have encountered in recent changes. Although Google Assistant on the lock screen presents a revolutionary way to interact with your phone, like any technology, it also comes with its share of challenges. Some of the common problems when using Google Assistant are:</p><ol><li><strong>Misunderstandings and misinterpretations</strong></li></ol><p>One prevalent issue users encounter is Google Assistant misunderstanding or misinterpreting voice commands. This can be influenced by factors such as background noise, accent variations, or pronunciation differences.</p><ol start="2"><li><strong>Limited context understanding</strong></li></ol><p>While Google Assistant is adept at understanding individual commands, it may struggle with complex, multi-step requests that rely heavily on context. Break down your tasks into simpler commands to enhance comprehension and execute it more accurately.</p><ol start="3"><li><strong>Inability to execute certain tasks</strong></li></ol><p>Google Assistant’s capabilities are extensive, but there are instances where it may struggle to execute specific tasks. For example, it can’t execute tasks that involve interacting with certain third-party applications or services. You can’t also <strong>unlock phone with voice Google Assistant.</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/unlock-phone-with-voice-google-assistant-4.jpg"                      alt="Giving command to Google Asisstant on lock screen"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135372/19272" target="_top" id="2135372">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135372" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="336" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135372/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Tips-to-Make-Voice-Google-Assistant-Recognize-Your-Commands"><a href="#Tips-to-Make-Voice-Google-Assistant-Recognize-Your-Commands" class="headerlink" title="Tips to Make Voice Google Assistant Recognize Your Commands"></a>Tips to Make Voice Google Assistant Recognize Your Commands</h3><p>One of the most infuriating problems with voice Google Assistant is that users often encounter difficulties in having their commands accurately recognized. To enhance the accuracy of voice recognition with Google Assistant, you can consider implementing the following tips:</p><ol><li><strong>Speak Clearly and Naturally</strong></li></ol><p>Make sure that you speak in a clear and natural manner. Avoid mumbling or speaking too quickly. Enunciate your words, giving Google Assistant a better chance to interpret your commands accurately.</p><ol start="2"><li><strong>Use Simple and Direct Phrases</strong></li></ol><p>Keep your commands simple and direct. Avoid unnecessary elaboration or complex sentence structures. Google Assistant is more likely to understand straightforward commands.</p><ol start="3"><li><strong>Check Your Microphone</strong></li></ol><p>Ensure that your device’s microphone is in good working condition. Dirt or debris on your phone’s microphone can affect its performance. Clean the microphone area and try again.</p><ol start="4"><li><strong>Quiet Environment</strong></li></ol><p>Background noise can interfere with voice recognition. Try to issue commands in a quiet environment to minimize any potential confusion caused by external sounds.</p><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-Unlock-Android-Phone-Screen-Without-Passcode"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-Unlock-Android-Phone-Screen-Without-Passcode" class="headerlink" title="Part 4.

Use Password Managers</strong>: Consider using reputable password manager apps that securely store and manage your passwords. These apps often have features to generate strong, unique passwords for different accounts and help you remember them.</li><li><strong>2. Set up Biometric Authentication</strong>: In case your device supports it, use biometric authentication methods for a better experience. These can be fingerprints or facial recognition. These methods can be more convenient than remembering passwords and offer added security.</li><li><strong>3. Create Memorable Passwords</strong>: If you opt against using a password manager, craft robust yet easily remembered passwords. To improve your security, try to use a sequence of lowercase and uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols. Plus, avoid easily guessable details like birthdays or common phrases to make your password strong.</li><li><strong>4. Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)</strong>: Enable two-factor authentication whenever possible for your accounts. Likewise, this provides an added layer of security by requiring a secondary verification method. It could be a text message code or authentication app in addition to your password.</li><li><strong>5. Regularly Back Up Your Data</strong>: Make it a habit to consistently <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/android-backup-and-restore/" >back up your device data <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

Use Password Managers</strong>: Consider using reputable password manager apps that securely store and manage your passwords. These apps often have features to generate strong, unique passwords for different accounts and help you remember them.</li><li><strong>2. Set up Biometric Authentication</strong>: In case your device supports it, use biometric authentication methods for a better experience. These can be fingerprints or facial recognition. These methods can be more convenient than remembering passwords and offer added security.</li><li><strong>3. Create Memorable Passwords</strong>: If you opt against using a password manager, craft robust yet easily remembered passwords. To improve your security, try to use a sequence of lowercase and uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols. Plus, avoid easily guessable details like birthdays or common phrases to make your password strong.</li><li><strong>4. Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)</strong>: Enable two-factor authentication whenever possible for your accounts. Likewise, this provides an added layer of security by requiring a secondary verification method. It could be a text message code or authentication app in addition to your password.</li><li><strong>5. Regularly Back Up Your Data</strong>: Make it a habit to consistently <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/android-backup-and-restore/" >back up your device data <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. To prevent potential data loss from forgotten passwords or unexpected issues, take precautions. Safeguard your crucial data by creating backups, whether in the cloud or on an external storage device.</li></ul><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>This article guided all the possible ways available in 2024 to reset your Android lock screen password, such as using the Smart Lock, Google Find My, Samsung SmartThings, and Wondershare Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (Android).

Moreover, Wondershare Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (Android) is compatible with Android 14 and can unlock the screen within 2 minutes.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2144282/7443" target="_top" id="2144282">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2144282" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2144282/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Still-Using-Pattern-Locks-with-Asus-ROG-Phone-8-Tips-Tricks-and-Helpful-Advice"><a href="#Still-Using-Pattern-Locks-with-Asus-ROG-Phone-8-Tips-Tricks-and-Helpful-Advice" class="headerlink" title="Still Using Pattern Locks with Asus ROG Phone 8?

Tips, Tricks and Helpful Advice</h2><p>They have been along for a long, long time now – pattern locks – the easiest of all smartphone locks. You just swipe your finger across to create an <strong>easy pattern lock</strong> of your choosing and that’s it, it becomes your new screen lock. No more remembering tedious digits! So, why have these easy pattern locks become outdated, and why do people still continue to use them? Let’s take a dive and find out all about pattern locks.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/09/easy-pattern-lock-1.jpg"                      alt="creating more secure pattern locks"                ></p><h2 id="Part-I-Things-To-Know-About-Pattern-Locks"><a href="#Part-I-Things-To-Know-About-Pattern-Locks" class="headerlink" title="Part I: Things To Know About Pattern Locks"></a>Part I: Things To Know About Pattern Locks</h2><p>The first cellphone locks were 4-digit number locks. Then came 6-digit codes, and even alphanumeric ones. Pattern locks were all the rage a while ago. Though pattern locks continue to be used, they are not considered safe to use any longer. What is all that about? Here’s what you need to know about pattern locks, whether you are a seasoned pattern lock user or not.</p><h3 id="I-I-What-Are-Pattern-Locks"><a href="#I-I-What-Are-Pattern-Locks" class="headerlink" title="I.I: What Are Pattern Locks?"></a>I.I: What Are Pattern Locks?</h3><p>Believe it or not, technology has advanced at such a rapid pace in the last two decades that you’d be forgiven if you don’t know what a pattern lock is, especially if you have only ever used iPhones, or Android phones in just the last few years.</p><p>Pattern locks are patterns you create on your smartphone and designate as a smartphone lock&#x2F; screen lock. There is a 9-point keypad of sorts, and you start swiping your finger from any point to any point for any which way you feel like. Android 13 allows a minimum of 4 points registered. They are easy to create, and easy to use, hence called easy pattern locks.</p><p>Pattern locks have only ever been offered on Android devices and were commonplace a few years ago until they were deemed not secure enough for use by modern standards because they were <em>easy</em> to figure out by malicious actors.</p><h3 id="I-II-Popularity-and-Usage"><a href="#I-II-Popularity-and-Usage" class="headerlink" title="I.II: Popularity and Usage"></a>I.II: Popularity and Usage</h3><p>Pattern lock is a feature unique to Android and has been so since the start. Naturally, it is one of the preferred ways users have come to unlock their Android devices over the years. Even though modern Android smartphones come with fingerprint recognition and face recognition technologies, there exists a large subset of users still addicted to and acclimatized with the pattern lock feature, opting over fingerprint and face recognition.</p><p>There has been, however, research conducted into the safety and security offered by pattern lock in Android.</p><h3 id="I-III-Advantages-and-Drawbacks"><a href="#I-III-Advantages-and-Drawbacks" class="headerlink" title="I.III: Advantages and Drawbacks"></a>I.III: Advantages and Drawbacks</h3><p>Modern smartphones very nearly contain the entirety of our lives; photo memories, video memories, important documents both financial and personal in nature, banking apps, ID and ATM&#x2F; credit cards in the “wallet” apps, and whatnot. A smartphone falling into the wrong hands could very nearly be used to devastate the rightful owner, both financially and otherwise. And this is not a claim out of thin air; spyware&#x2F; malware&#x2F; phishing attacks are on the rise around the world. Locking the smartphone, once considered optional and an unnecessary hassle, is now an absolute must.</p><h4 id="Advantages-of-Pattern-Locks"><a href="#Advantages-of-Pattern-Locks" class="headerlink" title="Advantages of Pattern Locks"></a>Advantages of Pattern Locks</h4><p>There is no denying that using an <strong>easy pattern lock</strong> to lock their smartphone seems enough for most users. Swiping your finger across your smartphone to unlock it feels not only cool and futuristic but safer and more secure than remembering and punching in digits. And, for the most part, it is true, given that 4-digit PINs can only have 10,000 unique combinations!</p><h4 id="Disadvantages-of-Pattern-Locks"><a href="#Disadvantages-of-Pattern-Locks" class="headerlink" title="Disadvantages of Pattern Locks"></a>Disadvantages of Pattern Locks</h4><p>While very easy to use, security researchers and experts have come to agree that the feature is not in the least safe to use, and that is because of how people use the pattern lock feature (discussed in detail below in part II). Some go so far as to say that most pattern locks can be breached in just 5 attempts or less. Imagine that!</p><p>What is more, research has found that humans have an uncanny ability to correctly guess a pattern lock simply by viewing the unlocking! The test comprised showing the test subjects videos of users unlocking their phones from different angles and varying distances, and it was found that around 64% of test subjects were able to correctly guess a 6-point pattern lock in one viewing only, and 80% could correctly guess the pattern after just two viewings. By contrast, only 11% were able to correctly deduce a 6-digit PIN after one viewing, and only 27% after viewing twice. This goes to show just how insecure pattern locks are!</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://zebaoaffiliateprogram.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137976/21526" target="_top" id="2137976">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/21526-2137976" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://zebaoaffiliateprogram.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137976/21526"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-II-How-People-Use-Pattern-Locks"><a href="#Part-II-How-People-Use-Pattern-Locks" class="headerlink" title="Part II: How People Use Pattern Locks"></a>Part II: How People Use Pattern Locks</h2><p>We might wonder how anyone would be able to guess the correct pattern of our device, but believe it or not, it is possible, eerily easily at that! We are all the same humans, after all! You know how people usually set PINs that could be significant dates in their lives? How they get car registration numbers that mean something to them? The same ‘logic’ applies to their setting pattern locks.</p><p>At DEFCON 23, Marte Loge, an M.Sc. Computer Science student, presented something that stunned people around the world. She said, “Tell me who you are, and I will tell you your lock pattern.” What followed was an expert presentation outlining and detailing user behaviors around pattern locks.</p><p>These are some commonly created pattern locks by people:</p><ul><li>- shapes of alphabets,</li><li>- shapes of numerals,</li><li>- any other easy-to-make, simple shape.</li></ul><p>Marte Loge presented the image below, showing how people naturally gravitate towards creating simple shape patterns, in her research.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/09/easy-pattern-lock-2.jpg"                      alt="common pattern locks"                ></p><p>To further help you see how easy it might be for anyone to guess your pattern, Marte Loge also presented some statistics.</p><ul><li>- 77% of people started their patterns in one of the 4 corners.</li><li>- 44% of Loge’s subjects started their pattern with the first dot, the top-left one. The next number was 15% for the top-right and 14% for the bottom-left.</li><li>- These percentages did not vary much depending on left-handedness or right-handedness.</li><li>- On average, irrespective of gender, people set 5-point patterns, with 4-point patterns being the most common. This means that the number of combinations on average was 7152 for 5-point patterns and a bogglingly low 1624 for 4-point patterns.</li></ul><p>The above data makes it amply clear how using an <strong>easy pattern lock</strong> is actually worse than using a 4-digit PIN, simply because how people are usually using the pattern lock feature.</p><h2 id="Part-III-Tips-For-Using-More-Secure-Pattern-Locks"><a href="#Part-III-Tips-For-Using-More-Secure-Pattern-Locks" class="headerlink" title="Part III: Tips For Using More Secure Pattern Locks"></a>Part III: Tips For Using More Secure Pattern Locks</h2><p>Now, we know how hard it is to break habits cemented over years of use, so in case you must at all costs use a pattern lock only, the least you can do is try and change your easy pattern lock to a better, more secure hard pattern lock.</p><h4 id="III-I-How-to-Create-More-Secure-Patterns"><a href="#III-I-How-to-Create-More-Secure-Patterns" class="headerlink" title="III.I: How to Create More Secure Patterns"></a>III.I: How to Create More Secure Patterns</h4><p>Here are some tips to help you create a better, more secure pattern lock for your smartphone.</p><ul><li>- Avoid using any of the corners to start the pattern.</li><li>- Never use your first initial as a pattern.</li><li>- Never use a digit shape as a pattern.</li><li>- You can pass through the same pattern lines multiple times over. This makes it more difficult for someone to guess your pattern correctly.</li><li>- Use all 9 points on the grid while setting the pattern lock! That simple act takes the possible pattern combinations to over 140,000, significantly more than 10,000 for 4-digit PINs, and vastly superior to paltry 1624 for a 4-point <strong>easy pattern lock</strong>!</li></ul><h4 id="III-II-Forgot-Your-Pattern-Unlock-Your-Asus-ROG-Phone-8-Without-Pattern-Lock-With-Dr-Fone"><a href="#III-II-Forgot-Your-Pattern-Unlock-Your-Asus-ROG-Phone-8-Without-Pattern-Lock-With-Dr-Fone" class="headerlink" title="III.II: Forgot Your Pattern?

To reach the lock screen settings android, you’ve to follow the path:</p><p>Options – Security – Screen Lock – Choose Screen Lock.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/android-lock-screen-settings-1.jpg"                      alt="android lock screen settings"                ></p><p>Now see how to unlock your lock screen in different ways.</p><h3 id="1-Slide"><a href="#1-Slide" class="headerlink" title="1.Slide"></a>1.Slide</h3><p>This is the most common method of unlocking an android lock screen. On all most all the android device, you’ll notice a lock mostly on the right side (sometimes on top) of a round charm. You just have to direct towards the lock and then the lock screen will be unlocked in no time. This method doesn’t provide any security (it just protects your device from sudden access by tapping on screen or any of the button) to your device as no password or PIN is required to set the “Slide” unlock.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/android-lock-screen-settings-3.jpg"                      alt="android lock screen settings"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://wigfever.sjv.io/c/5597632/2014851/22899" target="_top" id="2014851">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22899-2014851" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://wigfever.sjv.io/i/5597632/2014851/22899"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Keep your any finger on the middle of the round charm and by keeping your finger pressed, reach on the lock icon. The lock screen will be unlocked just after reaching your finger to the lock icon.</p><h3 id="2-Face-Unlock"><a href="#2-Face-Unlock" class="headerlink" title="2.Face Unlock"></a>2.Face Unlock</h3><p>This method of unlocking your lock screen needs your Android device to snap a photo of your with its camera. After you set the snapped photo as the unlocking recognition, you could unlock your device through showing your face on the screen.</p><p>Capture a picture of your face with your Android device’s camera and then set it for logging in into your device. From the lock screen, by just by holding your face, you can log in. It’s very interesting, but you should never rely on this method for strong security as this method of unlocking is prone to break easily as an intruder can unlock your device by putting a photo of you in front of your device. Moreover, this method sometimes doesn’t work properly. So it’s better to go for some other highly secured options for locking your screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/android-lock-screen-settings-4.jpg"                      alt="android lock screen settings"                ></p><h3 id="3-Pattern"><a href="#3-Pattern" class="headerlink" title="3.Pattern"></a>3.Pattern</h3><p>This is a way of setting pattern for lock screen from a grid of nine dots. You can select the pattern like some letter like Z, L or C etc, but nothing guarantees high security as the set pattern can be easily guessed or be seen while you are unlocking your device. Another problem is that by unlocking with the same pattern, your finger leaves some marks for the pattern’s path. By following the path, a stranger can unlock your device. So for little security, you can use pattern unlock method on your Android device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/android-lock-screen-settings-5.jpg"                      alt="android lock screen settings"                ></p><p>Go to the lock screen setting for Pattern and then set the pattern by sliding your finger from one dot to another, then another and like that way. Remember which pattern you’ve set in order to unlock your device in the next time.</p><h3 id="4-PIN"><a href="#4-PIN" class="headerlink" title="4.PIN"></a>4.PIN</h3><p>You might be troubled by thinking about the difference between PIN and Password. A little distinction is there for a PIN and that is it consists of numbers only whereas for password, you can associate some alphabetical letters or signs along with numbers.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/android-lock-screen-settings-6.jpg"                      alt="android lock screen settings"                ></p><p>Go to the lock screen setting for PIN and then set a PIN that consists of minimum 4 digits. It’s your choice to use 4 or more digit PIN. After setting the PIN, you can access your Android device by putting the PIN in a box from the lock screen. PIN protected lock screen is highly protected if the PIN is set strongly.</p><h3 id="5-Password"><a href="#5-Password" class="headerlink" title="5.Password"></a>5.Password</h3><p>In addition to PIN protection, you can consider it as password by adding some letters, special characters with the previously selected PIN codes. It’s also very much highly protected method of locking screen though you might be bored with tapping for the password again and again. But never ignore the value of your device’s files, so a password can be a well-sought lock screen protection for many users.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/android-lock-screen-settings-7.jpg"                      alt="android lock screen settings"                ></p><h3 id="6-Fingerprint"><a href="#6-Fingerprint" class="headerlink" title="6.Fingerprint"></a>6.Fingerprint</h3><p>In some of the modern Android device, you’ll find the feature of fingerprint unlocking. You can find the option through the screen or any dedicated button. By setting your fingerprint, you can unlock your device by tapping your finger on the Vivo Y17s device’s screen or the dedicated button.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/android-lock-screen-settings-8.jpg"                      alt="android lock screen settings"                ></p><h3 id="7-Voice"><a href="#7-Voice" class="headerlink" title="7.Voice"></a>7.Voice</h3><p>This is also a fun way of unlocking Android lock screen as you can unlock by saying the same voice that you’ve saved as the unlocking recognition.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/android-lock-screen-settings-9.jpg"                      alt="android lock screen settings"                ></p><p>Go to the setting from “Voice Unlock” button and record your voice such as “Open My Vivo Y17s” or as per your choice with clear sound. Repeat the voice a few more times as to match well. Then set and unlock your device from the lock screen by using the same voice command.</p><h2 id="Customize-Android-Lock-Screen"><a href="#Customize-Android-Lock-Screen" class="headerlink" title="Customize Android Lock Screen"></a>Customize Android Lock Screen</h2><p><strong>Lock Screen Widgets</strong></p><p>Widgets can be used from Android lock screen without unlocking the Vivo Y17s device first.

Repeat this process 10 to 11 times until you can no longer highlight the series.</li><li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Go back to the lock screen. Open the <strong>Camera</strong> app by tapping the camera icon or sliding left.

It can’t recognize your face. When you try multiple times in such cases, it will lock your device permanently. Are you stuck with a locked phone? And you’re still confused about what just happened. Face unlock may face problems such as</p><ul><li>Face unlock app may be buggy</li><li>Your face unlock settings may be unstable</li><li>Your phone camera or face unlock sensor may be damaged</li><li>Someone else may have registered their face without your permission</li></ul><p>Whatever the reason, they are equally big obstacles for you to use your phone as usual; trying to unlock your device can lead to a permanently locked phone. So how do you bypass face unlock?</p><p>Follow the guide below to bypass the face unlock settings and choose the best one for yourself.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/face-unlock-android-1.jpg"                      alt="face lock"                ></p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="How-To-Bypass-Android-Face-Lock-by-Ourselves"><a href="#How-To-Bypass-Android-Face-Lock-by-Ourselves" class="headerlink" title="How To Bypass Android Face Lock by Ourselves?"></a>How To Bypass Android Face Lock by Ourselves?</h2><p>If you want to bypass face lock by yourself, then different methods can help you. These are all tested and work well.</p><h3 id="1-A-Picture-Possibly-Bypasses-Face-Lock"><a href="#1-A-Picture-Possibly-Bypasses-Face-Lock" class="headerlink" title="1. A Picture Possibly Bypasses Face Lock"></a>1. A Picture Possibly Bypasses Face Lock</h3><p>You can use your photo to manipulate the face lock app. Simply use your photo to unlock the phone, which should work fine. If your phone doesn’t recognize your face from a photo, try again.</p><p>If it still doesn’t recognize your face, try a different photo or even change the camera’s lighting settings or the angles to see if that helps.</p><p>Anyway, this method is still unstable because of many uncontrollable factors. If everything fails, consider the following methods to bypass the face lock.</p><h3 id="2-Hard-Reset-your-phone"><a href="#2-Hard-Reset-your-phone" class="headerlink" title="2. Hard Reset your phone"></a>2. Hard Reset your phone</h3><p>To get around the Android lock screen, perform a factory reset. While resetting your phone allows you to set a new password, it also erases all data from your device. This method works like a charm, but it also requires more technical knowledge. To bypass screen lock via factory reset, follow these steps.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/face-unlock-android-2.jpg"                      alt="android hard reset"                ></p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Turn off your phone and hold the Power and Volume-down buttons simultaneously until the recovery mode screen appears. There are minor variations depending on the brand and model.</p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Select the Wipe data&#x2F;Factory Reset option using the volume buttons. To confirm the option, press the Power button.</p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Choose Yes &gt; Delete All User Data, then press the power button to continue. When the process is complete, turn on your phone.</p><p>So, before facing such awkward cases, like data loss, we suggest you have a backup habit of keeping your data safe.</p><h3 id="3-Google-Find-My-Device"><a href="#3-Google-Find-My-Device" class="headerlink" title="3. Google Find My Device"></a>3. Google Find My Device</h3><p>Google Find My Device is a service that lets you remotely lock, track, and wipe data from stolen or lost phones. With a Google account and the password, it won’t be complicated to remove any locks on your phone. You can bypass the Android lock screen by following the steps below:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/face-unlock-android-3.jpg"                      alt="google find my device data reset"                ></p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Navigate to Find My Device and sign in with your Google account.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Your phone receives a notification.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Select Erase Device, confirm, and click Erase as a warning pops up on the screen.</p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> The factory reset process on your phone begins. When it’s finished, choose My Google Account instead of using your phone as if it were brand new.</p><p>Just like the hard reset, after using Google Find My Device, all your data and settings will be erased. Please make everything well prepared before you decide to unlock your device.</p><h2 id="Easiest-Way-to-Unlock-Your-Android-Face-Recognition-Using-Dr-Fone-Screen-unlock"><a href="#Easiest-Way-to-Unlock-Your-Android-Face-Recognition-Using-Dr-Fone-Screen-unlock" class="headerlink" title="Easiest Way to Unlock Your Android Face Recognition Using Dr.Fone-Screen unlock"></a>Easiest Way to Unlock Your Android Face Recognition Using Dr.Fone-Screen unlock</h2><p>The methods mentioned above may be hard for you, and you don’t know any technical skills.

It helps in recognizing, managing, and connecting devices accurately.</li><li><strong>Traceability and Tracking:</strong> In cases of theft, loss, or unauthorized use, the IMEI number becomes a crucial tool for tracking.

These numbers help confirm the Huawei Nova Y91 device’s authenticity, purchase date, and warranty coverage. This streamlines the process of repairs and replacements.</li><li><strong>Security Measures:</strong> IMEI numbers play a role in security measures such as device blacklisting. If a device is reported stolen, its IMEI number can be added to a global database. This prevents it from being used on any network and renders it useless to thieves.</li></ol><h2 id="Part-2-A-Dedicated-Android-Solution-To-Track-Phone-Location-Using-IMEI-Number"><a href="#Part-2-A-Dedicated-Android-Solution-To-Track-Phone-Location-Using-IMEI-Number" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: A Dedicated Android Solution To Track Phone Location Using IMEI Number"></a>Part 2: A Dedicated Android Solution To Track Phone Location Using IMEI Number</h2><p>IMEI numbers are important for more than just working as identifiers.

Smart Lock is assigned to Bluetooth and Android NFC unlock devices.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14555162911081.jpg"                      alt="smart lock android"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14555165271526.jpg"                      alt="smart lock android"                ></p><p>Finally, trusted face unlocking is the ultimate face recognition system that unlocks your Android device as soon as you look at it across the front-facing camera.

Use Password Managers</strong>: Consider using reputable password manager apps that securely store and manage your passwords. These apps often have features to generate strong, unique passwords for different accounts and help you remember them.</li><li><strong>2. Set up Biometric Authentication</strong>: In case your device supports it, use biometric authentication methods for a better experience. These can be fingerprints or facial recognition. These methods can be more convenient than remembering passwords and offer added security.</li><li><strong>3. Create Memorable Passwords</strong>: If you opt against using a password manager, craft robust yet easily remembered passwords. To improve your security, try to use a sequence of lowercase and uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols. Plus, avoid easily guessable details like birthdays or common phrases to make your password strong.</li><li><strong>4. Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)</strong>: Enable two-factor authentication whenever possible for your accounts. Likewise, this provides an added layer of security by requiring a secondary verification method. It could be a text message code or authentication app in addition to your password.</li><li><strong>5. Regularly Back Up Your Data</strong>: Make it a habit to consistently <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/android-backup-and-restore/" >back up your device data <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.
