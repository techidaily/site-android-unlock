Here’s How You Can Unlock Lava Blaze 2 Pro Pattern Lock Screen"></a>Forgot Pattern Lock? Here’s How You Can Unlock Lava Blaze 2 Pro Pattern Lock Screen</h2><p>Forgetting the pattern lock of a device and getting locked out of it is probably one of the most frustrating scenarios faced by Android users. Nevertheless, unlike popular operating systems, Android provides a seamless way to past the forgot pattern lock feature.</p><p>You can either try Google’s native solution or a third-party tool in case you have forgotten the pattern lock on your device and reset it. In no time, you will be able to access your device (or even someone else’s phone by following these techniques). To make things easier for you, we have provided three simple solutions to resolve forgotten patterns on Android devices.</p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/68FqgS6Ym8E" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-bypass-forgot-pattern-lock-using-the-‘Forgot-Pattern’-feature"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-bypass-forgot-pattern-lock-using-the-‘Forgot-Pattern’-feature" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to bypass forgot pattern lock using the ‘Forgot Pattern’ feature?"></a>Part 1: How to bypass forgot pattern lock using the ‘Forgot Pattern’ feature?</h2><p>One of the easiest and fastest ways to fix the forgot pattern lock issue on a device is by using its inbuilt “Forgot Pattern” feature. If you are using an Android 4.4 or earlier version, then you can simply access this feature. Since users can hack an Android device just by knowing the Google credentials of the connected device, the solution was later discontinued (as it was considered a security vulnerability). Nevertheless, if your device hasn’t been updated and you are using an Android 4.4 or previous version, then you can bypass the forgot pattern lock by following these steps:</p><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Firstly, provide the wrong pattern to your device. It will let you know that you applied the incorrect pattern.</p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> On the same prompt, you can see an option of “Forgot pattern” on the bottom. Simply tap on it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/09/15059289368742.jpg"                      alt="forgot pattern"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3.</strong> This will open a new screen, which can be used to bypass the forgotten pattern of Android. Select the option for entering the Google Account details and proceed.</p><p><strong>Step 4.</strong> To reset the forgot pattern lock, you need to provide the correct Google credentials of the account already linked to the Lava Blaze 2 Pro device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/09/15059290192675.jpg"                      alt="enter google account"                ></p><p><strong>Step 5.</strong> After signing in to the interface, you will be asked to provide a new pattern lock for the Lava Blaze 2 Pro device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/09/15059290477717.jpg"                      alt="draw an unlock pattern"                ></p><p><strong>Step 6.</strong> Confirm your choice and set a new pattern lock on your device.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-get-past-forgot-pattern-lock-using-Dr-Fone-Screen-Unlock-Android"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-get-past-forgot-pattern-lock-using-Dr-Fone-Screen-Unlock-Android" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to get past forgot pattern lock using Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (Android)?"></a>Part 2: How to get past forgot pattern lock using Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (Android)?</h2><p>One of the major drawbacks of the “Forgot pattern” feature is that it doesn’t work on new Android devices. Since most of the Lava Blaze 2 Pro devices out there have been updated, the technique has been outdated.

Use Password Managers</strong>: Consider using reputable password manager apps that securely store and manage your passwords. These apps often have features to generate strong, unique passwords for different accounts and help you remember them.</li><li><strong>2. Set up Biometric Authentication</strong>: In case your device supports it, use biometric authentication methods for a better experience. These can be fingerprints or facial recognition. These methods can be more convenient than remembering passwords and offer added security.</li><li><strong>3. Create Memorable Passwords</strong>: If you opt against using a password manager, craft robust yet easily remembered passwords. To improve your security, try to use a sequence of lowercase and uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols. Plus, avoid easily guessable details like birthdays or common phrases to make your password strong.</li><li><strong>4. Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)</strong>: Enable two-factor authentication whenever possible for your accounts. Likewise, this provides an added layer of security by requiring a secondary verification method. It could be a text message code or authentication app in addition to your password.</li><li><strong>5. Regularly Back Up Your Data</strong>: Make it a habit to consistently <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/android-backup-and-restore/" >back up your device data <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

According to a recent survey, the majority of Android users were likely to wonder if they were able to reset Gmail password on Android devices.</p><p>Luckily for you, this performance is possible. In this article, a very informative and detailed description will be delivered to you to help you solve the problem of resetting your Gmail password.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Reset-Gmail-Password-When-you-Forget-it"><a href="#Part-1-Reset-Gmail-Password-When-you-Forget-it" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Reset Gmail Password When you Forget it"></a>Part 1: Reset Gmail Password When you Forget it</h2><p>There will be times when you come into the situation of not knowing what your Gmail password is, or you just simply forget it. You want to change your password but you don’t have access to a computer or laptop to perform this task.

Click on the Continue button as long as you have made sure to finish all these tasks.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14546022254697.jpg"                      alt="reset Gmail password on Android-create an account"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> In this step, you may be asked to fill in a CAPCHA form.

Or else, you can skip this step by clicking on I don’t know button.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14546022088819.jpg"                      alt="reset Gmail password on Android-fill in a CAPCHA form"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Finally, you will be shown a list of options on how to reset your Gmail password on Android devices.

It would help you to avoid wasting unnecessary time to sign in your account every time you need, not to mention that it prevent you from being confused of not knowing your account&#x2F;password.</li><li>You are capable of sorting your mails with a certain level of accuracy once you are fully aware of the features of Gmail app on Android devices.

One of them is the ability to make use of Gmail - a very famous email site nowadays.</p><p>Gmail being used directly by an Android tool is a great advantage, but it still contains some small drawbacks that users may have to go through. According to a recent survey, the majority of Android users were likely to wonder if they were able to reset Gmail password on Android devices.</p><p>Luckily for you, this performance is possible. In this article, a very informative and detailed description will be delivered to you to help you solve the problem of resetting your Gmail password.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Reset-Gmail-Password-When-you-Forget-it"><a href="#Part-1-Reset-Gmail-Password-When-you-Forget-it" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Reset Gmail Password When you Forget it"></a>Part 1: Reset Gmail Password When you Forget it</h2><p>There will be times when you come into the situation of not knowing what your Gmail password is, or you just simply forget it. You want to change your password but you don’t have access to a computer or laptop to perform this task. Now with the help of Android, you can do it through your own Android devices.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Visit the Gmail login page from your Android device. Click on the Need helpline, which is highlighted in blue.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14546021103734.jpg"                      alt="reset Gmail password on Android"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> After that, you will be moved to the Google Account Recovery page. There will be 3 main options which indicate 3 frequent problems. Select the first one, which is entitled “I don’t know my password”. Once you have chosen it, you will be required to fill in your Gmail address in the bar provided. Click on the Continue button as long as you have made sure to finish all these tasks.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14546022254697.jpg"                      alt="reset Gmail password on Android-create an account"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> In this step, you may be asked to fill in a CAPCHA form.

Or else, you can skip this step by clicking on I don’t know button.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14546022088819.jpg"                      alt="reset Gmail password on Android-fill in a CAPCHA form"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Finally, you will be shown a list of options on how to reset your Gmail password on Android devices. You can either use your alternative email address or your phone number to receive a verification code. Bear in mind to fill in any required information and put a check in the CAPCHA box to submit the process.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14546022423041.jpg"                      alt="reset Gmail password on Android-submit the process"                ></p><p><strong>Step 5:</strong> In this step, a blank bar will appear and it will demand you to type in your verification code. Just do it carefully to make sure there is no error. Once you have done it, a new screen will appear to tell you.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14546022635082.jpg"                      alt="reset Gmail password on Android-type in your verification code"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14546022939368.jpg"                      alt="reset Gmail password on Android-account assistance"                ></p><p><strong>Step 6:</strong> After you have done all the previous steps, you will know how to reset your Gmail password directly from your Android device.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Change-Gmail-Password-When-You-Still-Know-it"><a href="#Part-2-Change-Gmail-Password-When-You-Still-Know-it" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Change Gmail Password When You Still Know it"></a>Part 2: Change Gmail Password When You Still Know it</h2><p>Besides not knowing your password, there are still circumstances when you wish to change your current password for various reasons.

You must select the “Unlock Android Screen” option on the program.</p><p><strong>Step 2. Select Unlock Android Screen</strong></p><p>In this interface of Dr.Fone, please select “Unlock Android Screen” to keep your unlock process, or your phone cannot be unlocked as you wish.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/android-screen-unlock-3.png"                      alt="select unlock android screen"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3.

Below are the 5 most helpful tips that we want to offer you.</p><ol><li>Far from your imagination, Gmail on Android devices is capable of allowing you to make use of several accounts at the same time, even if it’s not a Gmail account. This performance not only helps you to organize your work better, but it also increase the efficiency of your job. Just simply log in your Gmail account on Gmail app, click on the down arrow which is placed next to your avatar and name, then choose Add account. You will be moved to another page, choose Personal (IMAP&#x2F;POP) choice and follow the detailed guide on the screen.</li><li>If your Android device is used by only one user, and you are guaranteed about the security of it, try to keep the Gmail logged in. It would help you to avoid wasting unnecessary time to sign in your account every time you need, not to mention that it prevent you from being confused of not knowing your account&#x2F;password.</li><li>You are capable of sorting your mails with a certain level of accuracy once you are fully aware of the features of Gmail app on Android devices. Just click on the email, then choose Settings menu and mark it as “Mark as not important”, “Mark important” or “Report to spam” owing to the priority of your email.</li><li>Gmail app provided you with the ability to have conversations online, and whenever a message comes, there will be a sound. In case you are in a vital conference, or you don’t want to be disturbed by the noise, you can mute it. All you have to do is to tap into the conversation, choose the three dots icon then click on the Mute option in the menu.</li><li>Enhance the speed and the accuracy of your search with the use of certain phrases. Let’s take an instance to see what Gmail can do for you in this case. If you want to search for the mails which have been sent by a certain person, typefrom:(name of the person on Gmail) in the searching bar. And in case you would love to look for a private message from that person, please type is:chat:(name of the person on Gmail) .</li></ol><h2 id="Part-4-Video-on-How-to-Reset-Gmail-Password-on-Android-Devices"><a href="#Part-4-Video-on-How-to-Reset-Gmail-Password-on-Android-Devices" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Video on How to Reset Gmail Password on Android Devices"></a>Part 4: Video on How to Reset Gmail Password on Android Devices</h2><iframe allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KvCMAn5bwx8" id="video-iframe-t"></iframe><h2 id="How-to-Unlock-a-Network-Locked-Huawei-Nova-Y91-Phone"><a href="#How-to-Unlock-a-Network-Locked-Huawei-Nova-Y91-Phone" class="headerlink" title="How to Unlock a Network Locked Huawei Nova Y91 Phone?"></a>How to Unlock a Network Locked Huawei Nova Y91 Phone?</h2><p>Revolutions in the telecommunication industry have introduced advancements in smartphone features and utilities. The other side of the coin is, however, not as appealing. Thanks to the different carrier services, network locking is the commonest issue of recent mobile launches. Users have reported of Huawei Nova Y91 phones refusing to work with different carriers.</p><p>The issue limits the smartphone’s functioning to the specific carrier from whom the Huawei Nova Y91 device is purchased. Consequently, there are annoying connectivity problems that restrict seamless mobile usage. The problem aggravates in geo-restricted regions where the carrier options are quite limited.

According to a recent survey, the majority of Android users were likely to wonder if they were able to reset Gmail password on Android devices.</p><p>Luckily for you, this performance is possible. In this article, a very informative and detailed description will be delivered to you to help you solve the problem of resetting your Gmail password.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Reset-Gmail-Password-When-you-Forget-it"><a href="#Part-1-Reset-Gmail-Password-When-you-Forget-it" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Reset Gmail Password When you Forget it"></a>Part 1: Reset Gmail Password When you Forget it</h2><p>There will be times when you come into the situation of not knowing what your Gmail password is, or you just simply forget it. You want to change your password but you don’t have access to a computer or laptop to perform this task. Now with the help of Android, you can do it through your own Android devices.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Visit the Gmail login page from your Android device.

There will be 3 main options which indicate 3 frequent problems. Select the first one, which is entitled “I don’t know my password”. Once you have chosen it, you will be required to fill in your Gmail address in the bar provided. Click on the Continue button as long as you have made sure to finish all these tasks.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14546022254697.jpg"                      alt="reset Gmail password on Android-create an account"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> In this step, you may be asked to fill in a CAPCHA form.

Or else, you can skip this step by clicking on I don’t know button.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14546022088819.jpg"                      alt="reset Gmail password on Android-fill in a CAPCHA form"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Finally, you will be shown a list of options on how to reset your Gmail password on Android devices.

If you haven’t set up a screen lock pattern on your device, then we recommend you to do the same right away. Not only will it keep intruders away, it will also protect your privacy. To learn how to set up a lock screen pattern on an Android device, simply follow these steps:</p><ul><li>1. Firstly, unlock your device and go to its Settings. You can access it from the Home Screen or from its Notification Center.</li><li>2. Under the personal or privacy section, you can access the “Lock Screen and Security” option.</li><li>3. In some versions, the option is also listed right at the top of the settings (in its quick access).</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/09/15057378431872.jpg"                      alt="setup android pattern lock screen-unlock your device"                > <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/09/15057378838236.jpg"                      alt="setup android pattern lock screen-Under the personal or privacy section"                > <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/09/15057379016188.jpg"                      alt="setup android pattern lock screen-access Lock Screen and Security"                ></p><ul><li>4. To set up a pattern lock screen, tap on the “Screen lock type” feature.</li><li>5. This will provide a list of all the different kinds of locks that you can apply. Ideally, it would be password, pin, pattern, swipe, or none. In “Swipe”, you can unlock a device just by swiping the screen. Whereas, in pattern, pin, or password, you would be needed to provide the respective pattern&#x2F;pin&#x2F;password to unlock the Huawei Nova Y71 device.</li><li>6. We recommend setting up a lock screen pattern instead. To do this, tap on the “Pattern” option.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/09/15057379466607.jpg"                      alt="setup android pattern lock screen-tap on the “Screen lock type” feature"                > <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/15057379692063.jpg"                      alt="setup android pattern lock screen- provide the respective pattern"                > <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/09/15057379835226.jpg"                      alt="setup android pattern lock screen-tap on the “Pattern” option"                ></p><ul><li>7. From the next screen, you can simply draw any kind of pattern of your choice. Ideally, it should join at least 4 dots on the screen. We recommend using a strong screen lock pattern to provide unmatched security to your device.</li><li>8. Furthermore, you need to confirm your choice and provide the same pattern once again. Make sure that you draw the same pattern here.</li><li>9. Additionally, the interface will ask you to provide a security pin as well. In case if you will forget your pattern, then you can access your phone by taking the assistance of this pin.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/09/15057380143598.jpg"                      alt="setup android pattern lock screen"                > <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/09/15057380317550.jpg"                      alt="setup android pattern lock screen-provide the same pattern"                > <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/09/15057380506350.jpg"                      alt="setup android pattern lock screen-provide a security pin"                ></p><ul><li>10.

By completing these steps, a screen lock pattern will be implemented on your device.</li></ul><p>Later, you can follow the same drill to change your device’s lock screen pattern as well. Though, you would be needed to provide the existing pattern to access these features. Out of all the lock screen options, you should go with the pattern lock.

In this article, a very informative and detailed description will be delivered to you to help you solve the problem of resetting your Gmail password.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Reset-Gmail-Password-When-you-Forget-it"><a href="#Part-1-Reset-Gmail-Password-When-you-Forget-it" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Reset Gmail Password When you Forget it"></a>Part 1: Reset Gmail Password When you Forget it</h2><p>There will be times when you come into the situation of not knowing what your Gmail password is, or you just simply forget it. You want to change your password but you don’t have access to a computer or laptop to perform this task. Now with the help of Android, you can do it through your own Android devices.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Visit the Gmail login page from your Android device. Click on the Need helpline, which is highlighted in blue.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14546021103734.jpg"                      alt="reset Gmail password on Android"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> After that, you will be moved to the Google Account Recovery page.

Below are the 5 most helpful tips that we want to offer you.</p><ol><li>Far from your imagination, Gmail on Android devices is capable of allowing you to make use of several accounts at the same time, even if it’s not a Gmail account. This performance not only helps you to organize your work better, but it also increase the efficiency of your job. Just simply log in your Gmail account on Gmail app, click on the down arrow which is placed next to your avatar and name, then choose Add account. You will be moved to another page, choose Personal (IMAP&#x2F;POP) choice and follow the detailed guide on the screen.</li><li>If your Android device is used by only one user, and you are guaranteed about the security of it, try to keep the Gmail logged in. It would help you to avoid wasting unnecessary time to sign in your account every time you need, not to mention that it prevent you from being confused of not knowing your account&#x2F;password.</li><li>You are capable of sorting your mails with a certain level of accuracy once you are fully aware of the features of Gmail app on Android devices. Just click on the email, then choose Settings menu and mark it as “Mark as not important”, “Mark important” or “Report to spam” owing to the priority of your email.</li><li>Gmail app provided you with the ability to have conversations online, and whenever a message comes, there will be a sound. In case you are in a vital conference, or you don’t want to be disturbed by the noise, you can mute it. All you have to do is to tap into the conversation, choose the three dots icon then click on the Mute option in the menu.</li><li>Enhance the speed and the accuracy of your search with the use of certain phrases. Let’s take an instance to see what Gmail can do for you in this case. If you want to search for the mails which have been sent by a certain person, typefrom:(name of the person on Gmail) in the searching bar. And in case you would love to look for a private message from that person, please type is:chat:(name of the person on Gmail) .</li></ol><h2 id="Part-4-Video-on-How-to-Reset-Gmail-Password-on-Android-Devices"><a href="#Part-4-Video-on-How-to-Reset-Gmail-Password-on-Android-Devices" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Video on How to Reset Gmail Password on Android Devices"></a>Part 4: Video on How to Reset Gmail Password on Android Devices</h2><iframe allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KvCMAn5bwx8" id="video-iframe-t"></iframe><h2 id="Unlocking-the-Power-of-Smart-Lock-A-Beginner’s-Guide-for-HTC-U23-Pro-Users"><a href="#Unlocking-the-Power-of-Smart-Lock-A-Beginner’s-Guide-for-HTC-U23-Pro-Users" class="headerlink" title="Unlocking the Power of Smart Lock: A Beginner’s Guide for HTC U23 Pro Users"></a>Unlocking the Power of Smart Lock: A Beginner’s Guide for HTC U23 Pro Users</h2><p>Google constantly comes up with features to simplify the way users interact and complete tasks on the Android platform. One of the most important features that techies loved to debate about was the Smart Lock Android, a secure password manager functioning in sync with a Google account on the Android phone.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Android-Smart-Lock"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Android-Smart-Lock" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is Android Smart Lock?"></a>Part 1: What is Android Smart Lock?</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14555162221345.jpg"                      alt="smart lock android"                ></p><p>Android Lollipop added a feature called Smart Lock, and the feature was devised as a smart tool to prevent the Android phone from locking once it was initially unlocked. In other words, the feature overrides an Android phone’s Lock Screen feature, thereby saving users the need to enter passwords every time the HTC U23 Pro device locks.</p><p>If you’re at home, it’s likely your android phone is locked out if you haven’t accessed at for some time. Smart Locks solves the problem in many ways. It allows you to allocate trusted places. Once you within range of the trusted places, your phone won’t lock. Trusted devices come next. Smart Lock is assigned to Bluetooth and Android NFC unlock devices.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14555162911081.jpg"                      alt="smart lock android"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14555165271526.jpg"                      alt="smart lock android"                ></p><p>Finally, trusted face unlocking is the ultimate face recognition system that unlocks your Android device as soon as you look at it across the front-facing camera.

You can then use the pointer to unlock the pattern or enter the HTC U23 Pro device’s password lock.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14531933791903.jpg"                      alt="unlock android with broken screen"                ></p><p>You can then go about backing up the contents of your device.</p><h2 id="Method-3-Using-your-Samsung-Account"><a href="#Method-3-Using-your-Samsung-Account" class="headerlink" title="Method 3: Using your Samsung Account"></a>Method 3: Using your Samsung Account</h2><p>This method is a reliable way to unlock a Samsung device that has a broken screen or is not working correctly. While it is highly effective you will need to have a Samsung account registered with your device. The problem is that not many Samsung device users have registered their devices with the service. If you are among the lucky few who have, here’s how to use your account to unlock your device.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Visit the <a class="link"   href="https://findmymobile.samsung.com/login.do" >https://findmymobile.samsung.com/login.do <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> on your PC or any other device and log in with your account information.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14531933993021.jpg"                      alt="unlock android with broken screen"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Select your device from the menu on the left-hand side of the screen.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> You should see the option “Unlock my screen” on the sidebar. Click on it and you will get instructions on how to access your device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14531934188479.jpg"                      alt="unlock android using samsung account"                ></p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Being unable to unlock your device is never a good place to be. We hope one of the above solutions will work for you. You can then gain access to your device and back up the files and contacts. This way your life doesn’t have to be disrupted- you can just restore the backup on a new device or the old one once the screen is fixed.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins><br><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://android-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-top-apps-and-online-tools-to-track-vivo-y78-5g-phone-withwithout-imei-number-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, Top Apps and Online Tools To Track Vivo Y78 5G Phone With/Without IMEI Number</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-unlock.techidaily.com/rootjunky-apk-to-bypass-google-frp-lock-for-vivo-t2-5g-by-drfone-android/"><u>Rootjunky APK To Bypass Google FRP Lock For Vivo T2 5G</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-10-easy-to-use-frp-bypass-tools-for-unlocking-google-accounts-on-samsung-galaxy-a14-5g-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, 10 Easy-to-Use FRP Bypass Tools for Unlocking Google Accounts On Samsung Galaxy A14 5G</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-unlock.techidaily.com/bypassing-google-account-with-vnrom-bypass-for-sony-xperia-1-v-by-drfone-android/"><u>Bypassing Google Account With vnROM Bypass For Sony Xperia 1 V</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-unlock.techidaily.com/remove-the-lock-screen-fingerprint-of-your-oppo-find-x7-by-drfone-android/"><u>Remove the Lock Screen Fingerprint Of Your Oppo Find X7</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-unlock.techidaily.com/how-to-enable-usb-debugging-on-a-locked-gionee-phone-by-drfone-android/"><u>How To Enable USB Debugging on a Locked Gionee Phone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-show-wi-fi-password-on-samsung-galaxy-s24-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, How to Show Wi-Fi Password on Samsung Galaxy S24</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-unlock.techidaily.com/tips-and-tricks-for-setting-up-your-vivo-s17-pro-phone-pattern-lock-by-drfone-android/"><u>Tips and Tricks for Setting Up your Vivo S17 Pro Phone Pattern Lock</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-rootjunky-apk-to-bypass-google-frp-lock-for-vivo-t2-5g-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, Rootjunky APK To Bypass Google FRP Lock For Vivo T2 5G</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-unlock.techidaily.com/best-ways-on-how-to-unlockbypassswiperemove-samsung-galaxy-a05s-fingerprint-lock-by-drfone-android/"><u>Best Ways on How to Unlock/Bypass/Swipe/Remove Samsung Galaxy A05s Fingerprint Lock</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-unlock.techidaily.com/top-4-sim-location-trackers-to-easily-find-your-lost-samsung-galaxy-s24plus-device-by-drfone-android/"><u>Top 4 SIM Location Trackers To Easily Find Your Lost Samsung Galaxy S24+ Device</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-unlock.techidaily.com/how-to-remove-forgotten-pin-of-your-oppo-f25-pro-5g-by-drfone-android/"><u>How to Remove Forgotten PIN Of Your Oppo F25 Pro 5G</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-show-wi-fi-password-on-vivo-y200-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, How to Show Wi-Fi Password on Vivo Y200</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-can-i-bypass-a-forgotten-phone-password-of-oppo-a59-5g-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, Can I Bypass a Forgotten Phone Password Of Oppo A59 5G?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-unlock.techidaily.com/how-to-reset-your-vivo-y02t-lock-screen-password-by-drfone-android/"><u>How to Reset your Vivo Y02T Lock Screen Password</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-lock-your-vivo-v29e-phone-in-style-the-top-5-gesture-lock-screen-apps-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, Lock Your Vivo V29e Phone in Style The Top 5 Gesture Lock Screen Apps</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-unlocking-the-power-of-smart-lock-a-beginners-guide-for-samsung-galaxy-s23-ultra-users-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, Unlocking the Power of Smart Lock A Beginners Guide for Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra Users</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-unlock.techidaily.com/forgotten-the-voicemail-password-of-oppo-a79-5g-try-these-fixes-by-drfone-android/"><u>Forgotten The Voicemail Password Of Oppo A79 5G?

As a result, the use of Android as an operating system for both PC and portable tools is becoming an extremely hot trend.</p><p>Android devices pride themselves on providing their customers with the best features possible. Not only do they support offline features, but Android devices are also capable of offering users with several services online. One of them is the ability to make use of Gmail - a very famous email site nowadays.</p><p>Gmail being used directly by an Android tool is a great advantage, but it still contains some small drawbacks that users may have to go through. According to a recent survey, the majority of Android users were likely to wonder if they were able to reset Gmail password on Android devices.</p><p>Luckily for you, this performance is possible. In this article, a very informative and detailed description will be delivered to you to help you solve the problem of resetting your Gmail password.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Reset-Gmail-Password-When-you-Forget-it"><a href="#Part-1-Reset-Gmail-Password-When-you-Forget-it" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Reset Gmail Password When you Forget it"></a>Part 1: Reset Gmail Password When you Forget it</h2><p>There will be times when you come into the situation of not knowing what your Gmail password is, or you just simply forget it. You want to change your password but you don’t have access to a computer or laptop to perform this task. Now with the help of Android, you can do it through your own Android devices.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Visit the Gmail login page from your Android device. Click on the Need helpline, which is highlighted in blue.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14546021103734.jpg"                      alt="reset Gmail password on Android"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> After that, you will be moved to the Google Account Recovery page. There will be 3 main options which indicate 3 frequent problems. Select the first one, which is entitled “I don’t know my password”. Once you have chosen it, you will be required to fill in your Gmail address in the bar provided.

But how much can you do with your Android phone? Developers are always making it more interesting to use this interface.</p><p>Most of the time, we use Android phones, we get faced with the need to access the internet. The Wi-Fi capability of these Android gadgets makes it super easy for us to surf the web. Throughout using Wi-Fi, we connect to a number of them. This could be at school, a sub-way café, the gym, buses, hospitals, hotels, towns, and the list is endless. A password secures most of this. Needless to say, our brain is weak to store all these passwords for future use, especially if you would want to connect with a different gadget you have recently bought or even your laptop.

You have probably used a Windows computer or even Linux. For the case of Windows, when installing a new program or software, it always prompts a dialog box saying, “Administrator permission required to run this program.” If you don’t have the administrator permission, you won’t install the program. In Android, this is called rooting. In simple terms, it means having the root permission to your phone. Some Android apps will require you the root permission, e.g., flashing your ROM. In this part, we will explain how you can show the Wi-Fi password on your Android with root.</p><p>To find the Wi-Fi passwords on your Android phone, you need to have an app to explore files which also supports a root user. In this case, ES FileExplorer or Root Explorer will come in handy. However, it turns out that the latter is offered at $3. Let’s use the free ES File Explorer.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14556285763404.jpg"                      alt="android show wifi password"                ></p><h3 id="Steps-of-getting-Wi-Fi-password-on-Android-with-root"><a href="#Steps-of-getting-Wi-Fi-password-on-Android-with-root" class="headerlink" title="Steps of getting Wi-Fi password on Android with root"></a>Steps of getting Wi-Fi password on Android with root</h3><p>In only four steps, we, at this moment, learn how we can find the password of a Wi-Fi on an Android phone.</p><p>Step 1: Install the ES File Explorer</p><p>Download the ES File Explorer from your play store, install it, and open it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14556286507084.jpg"                      alt="android show wifi password"                ></p><p>Step 2: Enable Root Explorer</p><p>The root explorer needs to be enabled so that you can reach the root folders of the Wi-Fi passwords you need.

The short answer is yes. However, this is a bit involving but simple. You don’t need to be a computer guru to do it, but you need to have a computer and some internet access of course. The key thing is to find a way through which we can fetch the password file from the phone without using a root access protocol in the Android. This is made possible by some little programming insight using the Windows Command prompt.</p><h3 id="Steps-to-show-Wi-Fi-password-on-Android-without-root"><a href="#Steps-to-show-Wi-Fi-password-on-Android-without-root" class="headerlink" title="Steps to show Wi-Fi password on Android without root"></a>Steps to show Wi-Fi password on Android without root</h3><p>Step 1: Access the Developer authority</p><p>To access the files that Android uses to run passwords, you must first become a developer. This is very simple.</p><p>Get your Android phone and go to settings. Scroll down and find “About phone.” Tap on it and scroll down again to find Build number.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14556302638925.jpg"                      alt="android show wifi password"                ></p><p>Tap on this “build number” 5 to 6 times until a message pops up, saying, “You are now a developer”.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14556303263992.jpg"                      alt="android show wifi password"                ></p><p>Step 2: Enable the debugging.</p><p>Go back to Settings. Scroll down for developer options. Turn on the button for “Android&#x2F;USB debugging”.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14556308665697.jpg"                      alt="android show wifi password"                ></p><p>Step 3: Install ADB drivers.</p><p>Now, open your Windows desktop. Download and install ADB drivers. (Use this download link <a class="link"   href="http://adbdriver.com/" >adbdriver.com <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>). You need to download and install platform tools (minimal ADB and fastboot) from <a class="link"   href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2317790" >http://forum.xda-developers.com/... <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> Now open the folder where you’ve installed the above tools. By default, it is in the Local disc <em>C\windows\system32\platform_tools</em> location. However, you might want to locate them by searching on the windows search engine. You have to hold the Shift key and right-click inside the folder to click on”Open Command Window Here.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14556329561742.jpg"                      alt="android show wifi password"                ></p><p>Step 4: Test the ADB</p><p>Here, we would like to test whether the ABD is working properly. To do this, connect your phone to the PC using a USB. In the command prompt, type <strong>adb services</strong> and then press enter. If it’s working properly, you should see a device on this list.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14556329984622.jpg"                      alt="android show wifi password"                ></p><p>Step 5: Find the Android wifi password.</p><p>Now, it is time to type the given command in the command prompt and type: <em>adb pull &#x2F;data&#x2F;misc&#x2F;wifi&#x2F;wpa_supplicant.conf c:&#x2F;wpa_supplicant.conf</em>. This will fetch the file from your phone to the local disc C drive of the PC.</p><p>Step 6: Get the wifi passwords.</p><p>Lastly, open the file with a notepad, and there you go.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14556331232772.jpg"                      alt="android show

As a result, the use of Android as an operating system for both PC and portable tools is becoming an extremely hot trend.</p><p>Android devices pride themselves on providing their customers with the best features possible. Not only do they support offline features, but Android devices are also capable of offering users with several services online. One of them is the ability to make use of Gmail - a very famous email site nowadays.</p><p>Gmail being used directly by an Android tool is a great advantage, but it still contains some small drawbacks that users may have to go through. According to a recent survey, the majority of Android users were likely to wonder if they were able to reset Gmail password on Android devices.</p><p>Luckily for you, this performance is possible. In this article, a very informative and detailed description will be delivered to you to help you solve the problem of resetting your Gmail password.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Reset-Gmail-Password-When-you-Forget-it"><a href="#Part-1-Reset-Gmail-Password-When-you-Forget-it" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Reset Gmail Password When you Forget it"></a>Part 1: Reset Gmail Password When you Forget it</h2><p>There will be times when you come into the situation of not knowing what your Gmail password is, or you just simply forget it. You want to change your password but you don’t have access to a computer or laptop to perform this task. Now with the help of Android, you can do it through your own Android devices.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Visit the Gmail login page from your Android device. Click on the Need helpline, which is highlighted in blue.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14546021103734.jpg"                      alt="reset Gmail password on Android"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> After that, you will be moved to the Google Account Recovery page. There will be 3 main options which indicate 3 frequent problems. Select the first one, which is entitled “I don’t know my password”. Once you have chosen it, you will be required to fill in your Gmail address in the bar provided. Click on the Continue button as long as you have made sure to finish all these tasks.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14546022254697.jpg"                      alt="reset Gmail password on Android-create an account"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> In this step, you may be asked to fill in a CAPCHA form. Just simply do it and move to the next page. There you had better type in the last password that you are still able to recall if possible, then click on the Continue button to move. Or else, you can skip this step by clicking on I don’t know button.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14546022088819.jpg"                      alt="reset Gmail password on Android-fill in a CAPCHA form"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Finally, you will be shown a list of options on how to reset your Gmail password on Android devices. You can either use your alternative email address or your phone number to receive a verification code. Bear in mind to fill in any required information and put a check in the CAPCHA box to submit the process.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14546022423041.jpg"                      alt="reset Gmail password on Android-submit the process"                ></p><p><strong>Step 5:</strong> In this step, a blank bar will appear and it will demand you to type in your verification code.

This allows users to customize their devices extensively. However, despite this openness, certain features and capabilities can still be locked or restricted, either by Google or the Asus ROG Phone 8 Pro device manufacturer.</p><p>For those looking to truly unleash the full potential of their Android device, an OEM unlock is an essential step. This article will delve into the process of <strong>OEM unlocking on Android</strong>, guiding you through its benefits and how to safely perform it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/what-is-oem-unlock-01.jpg"                      alt="android phone with padlock"                ></p><p><strong>OEM lock</strong> might sound like technical jargon to many.

It allows users to access and modify the Asus ROG Phone 8 Pro device’s software at the deepest level.</p><p>This can enable the installation of apps and software that require more permissions than what is typically available.

There’s always a chance of bricking your phone, especially if the unlocking process isn’t followed correctly or an unstable custom ROM is installed.</p><p>Additionally, most manufacturers will void your warranty once you unlock the bootloader.

This process is also an easy one to follow, as long as you still hold good memory of the security code.</p><p>· Step 1: On the main screen of your Android devices, tap on the gear icon. It will directly lead you to the Settings menu of the phone. After that, a drop-down menu will appear with several choices and bars. Among them, tap on the Security option to begin your work.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14555320015997.jpg"                      alt="disable lock screen android"                ></p><p>· Step 2: Under the heading called Screen Security heading, you will be shown 3 choices. Tap on the first one, which is entitled Screen lock.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14555321966246.jpg"                      alt="disable lock screen android"                ></p><p>· Step 3: Once you have done the previous step, a brand new screen will appear and then you will be asked to fill in your PIN code. This is a step that helps guarantee that you are the true owner of the Android device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14555322112292.jpg"                      alt="disable lock screen android"                ></p><p>Step 4: As soon as you have confirmed the right PIN code in the bar provided, you will then be presented to the next drop-down menu. A similar screen will appear which shows you plenty of choices. Tap on the top of that list, which is a bar called None.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14555322276060.jpg"                      alt="disable lock screen android"                ></p><p>Step 5: In the end, you have successfully disabled the screen lock on your Android devices. You are now capable of using it without any hesitation about the screen lock.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Common-Problems-of-Disabling-Lock-Screen"><a href="#Part-3-Common-Problems-of-Disabling-Lock-Screen" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Common Problems of Disabling Lock Screen"></a>Part 3: Common Problems of Disabling Lock Screen</h2><p>The process to disable the screen lock on Android may seem easy to handle as well as straightforward to several customers, but there are still some annoying problems that users have to deal with while trying to disable the lock screen.</p><p>What are the top 2 common problems?</p><p>Below are the two most common problems faced by Android users during their efforts to disable the feature of screen lock.</p><p><strong>1. In the Screen Security choice, the None bar can not be chosen.</strong></p><p>Description of the problem: There is a sentence below it stated: “Disabled by administrators, encryption policy or credential storage”. All the space of the None option is in white and grey.</p><p>The solution to this problem is quite simple. Once you have made sure you are suffering from this nasty one, try to follow these below pieces of advice to see if it is capable of giving you a hand.</p><p>Step 1: Open the Settings menu from the main screen. Then tap on the Credential Storage. You will see a drop-down menu like the screenshot below.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14556834486843.jpg"                      alt="disable lock screen android"                ></p><p>Step 2: Continue to tap on the Clear Credentials (Remove all certificates) option. Then next click on the OK button. Wait for some seconds until your Android device has finished the process.</p><p>Step 3: To make sure that the previous step has been performed successfully, try looking at the bottom of the drop-down menu. If the Clear Credentials (Remove all certificates) are grey out and can not be selected, then you have managed to do it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14556833184389.jpg"                      alt="disable lock screen android"                ></p><p>Step 4: Now that the problem is solved, you can feel free to turn back to your Screen lock option in the beginning and disable the feature of locking screen Android as usual.</p><p>2. You have mistakenly encrypted your SD card. You want to disable the encryption, only to realize that it requires you to set a new screen lock code. But when you come to the Screen lock menu, all the options but Password have been greyed out.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14555323367933.jpg"                      alt="disable lock screen android"                ><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14555323405268.jpg"                      alt="disable lock screen android"                ></p><p>This is pretty weird, but actually, it is one of the most common troubles that many users have complained about. But to your surprise, the solution is very simple and easy. All you have to do is to reset your password, but with a little change. Your password MUST include at least ONE NUMBER in it. Confirm your new password then you will be able to disable the lock screen Android as usual.</p><h2 id="Bonus-Tip-Remove-Android-Screen-Lock-If-Forgotten-Password-Pattern"><a href="#Bonus-Tip-Remove-Android-Screen-Lock-If-Forgotten-Password-Pattern" class="headerlink" title="Bonus Tip: Remove Android Screen Lock If Forgotten Password&#x2F;Pattern"></a>Bonus Tip: Remove Android Screen Lock If Forgotten Password&#x2F;Pattern</h2><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/68FqgS6Ym8E" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe><p>As much as the lock screen can protect the personal information on the phone, it can also cause much trouble if you forget the lock screen password or enter the wrong password too many times.

One of them is the ability to make use of Gmail - a very famous email site nowadays.</p><p>Gmail being used directly by an Android tool is a great advantage, but it still contains some small drawbacks that users may have to go through. According to a recent survey, the majority of Android users were likely to wonder if they were able to reset Gmail password on Android devices.</p><p>Luckily for you, this performance is possible. In this article, a very informative and detailed description will be delivered to you to help you solve the problem of resetting your Gmail password.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Reset-Gmail-Password-When-you-Forget-it"><a href="#Part-1-Reset-Gmail-Password-When-you-Forget-it" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Reset Gmail Password When you Forget it"></a>Part 1: Reset Gmail Password When you Forget it</h2><p>There will be times when you come into the situation of not knowing what your Gmail password is, or you just simply forget it. You want to change your password but you don’t have access to a computer or laptop to perform this task. Now with the help of Android, you can do it through your own Android devices.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Visit the Gmail login page from your Android device. Click on the Need helpline, which is highlighted in blue.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14546021103734.jpg"                      alt="reset Gmail password on Android"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> After that, you will be moved to the Google Account Recovery page. There will be 3 main options which indicate 3 frequent problems. Select the first one, which is entitled “I don’t know my password”. Once you have chosen it, you will be required to fill in your Gmail address in the bar provided. Click on the Continue button as long as you have made sure to finish all these tasks.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14546022254697.jpg"                      alt="reset Gmail password on Android-create an account"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> In this step, you may be asked to fill in a CAPCHA form. Just simply do it and move to the next page. There you had better type in the last password that you are still able to recall if possible, then click on the Continue button to move. Or else, you can skip this step by clicking on I don’t know button.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14546022088819.jpg"                      alt="reset Gmail password on Android-fill in a CAPCHA form"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Finally, you will be shown a list of options on how to reset your Gmail password on Android devices. You can either use your alternative email address or your phone number to receive a verification code. Bear in mind to fill in any required information and put a check in the CAPCHA box to submit the process.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14546022423041.jpg"                      alt="reset Gmail password on Android-submit the process"                ></p><p><strong>Step 5:</strong> In this step, a blank bar will appear and it will demand you to type in your verification code. Just do it carefully to make sure there is no error. Once you have done it, a new screen will appear to tell you.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14546022635082.jpg"                      alt="reset Gmail password on Android-type in your verification code"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14546022939368.jpg"                      alt="reset Gmail password on Android-account assistance"                ></p><p><strong>Step 6:</strong> After you have done all the previous steps, you will know how to reset your Gmail password directly from your Android device.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Change-Gmail-Password-When-You-Still-Know-it"><a href="#Part-2-Change-Gmail-Password-When-You-Still-Know-it" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Change Gmail Password When You Still Know it"></a>Part 2: Change Gmail Password When You Still Know it</h2><p>Besides not knowing your password, there are still circumstances when you wish to change your current password for various reasons. Just simply follow these steps.</p><p>Step 1: Make sure your Android device is connected with the Internet. Then get access to the link myaccount.google.com. After logging into your account (or maybe you have already done this), scroll down, find the Sign-in and security option and choose it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14546023162049.jpg"                      alt="reset Gmail password on Android-find the Sign-in and security option"                ></p><p>Step 2: Find the Password option in the list.

Below are the 5 most helpful tips that we want to offer you.</p><ol><li>Far from your imagination, Gmail on Android devices is capable of allowing you to make use of several accounts at the same time, even if it’s not a Gmail account. This performance not only helps you to organize your work better, but it also increase the efficiency of your job. Just simply log in your Gmail account on Gmail app, click on the down arrow which is placed next to your avatar and name, then choose Add account. You will be moved to another page, choose Personal (IMAP&#x2F;POP) choice and follow the detailed guide on the screen.</li><li>If your Android device is used by only one user, and you are guaranteed about the security of it, try to keep the Gmail logged in. It would help you to avoid wasting unnecessary time to sign in your account every time you need, not to mention that it prevent you from being confused of not knowing your account&#x2F;password.</li><li>You are capable of sorting your mails with a certain level of accuracy once you are fully aware of the features of Gmail app on Android devices. Just click on the email, then choose Settings menu and mark it as “Mark as not important”, “Mark important” or “Report to spam” owing to the priority of your email.</li><li>Gmail app provided you with the ability to have conversations online, and whenever a message comes, there will be a sound. In case you are in a vital conference, or you don’t want to be disturbed by the noise, you can mute it. All you have to do is to tap into the conversation, choose the three dots icon then click on the Mute option in the menu.</li><li>Enhance the speed and the accuracy of your search with the use of certain phrases. Let’s take an instance to see what Gmail can do for you in this case. If you want to search for the mails which have been sent by a certain person, typefrom:(name of the person on Gmail) in the searching bar. And in case you would love to look for a private message from that person, please type is:chat:(name of the person on Gmail) .</li></ol><h2 id="Part-4-Video-on-How-to-Reset-Gmail-Password-on-Android-Devices"><a href="#Part-4-Video-on-How-to-Reset-Gmail-Password-on-Android-Devices" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Video on How to Reset Gmail Password on Android Devices"></a>Part 4: Video on How to Reset Gmail Password on Android Devices</h2><iframe allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KvCMAn5bwx8" id="video-iframe-t"></iframe><h2 id="How-To-Unlock-Any-Asus-ROG-Phone-8-Phone-Password-Using-Emergency-Call"><a href="#How-To-Unlock-Any-Asus-ROG-Phone-8-Phone-Password-Using-Emergency-Call" class="headerlink" title="How To Unlock Any Asus ROG Phone 8 Phone Password Using Emergency Call"></a>How To Unlock Any Asus ROG Phone 8 Phone Password Using Emergency Call</h2><p>Today, smartphones are an extension of people. Securing them with a PIN, passcode, pattern, fingerprint, or face unlock has become the norm. It’s like putting a digital lock on our private world.</p><p>But you have to face it: sometimes, people forget the codes they set to protect their phones or can’t unlock them with their injured fingers or faces. Picture this: you’re staring at your phone screen, trying to recall that password, but it’s not coming to you.</p><p>That’s where emergency call bypass is a nifty little trick that can be a lifesaver. In this article, you’ll learn <strong>how to unlock any phone password using the emergency call</strong> technique. The article will also explore other methods for when your memory fails you. So, read through and never go through this trouble again.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/unlock-emergency-call-phone-01.jpeg"                      alt="android emergency call screen"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-the-Emergency-Call-Bypass-Method"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-the-Emergency-Call-Bypass-Method" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Is the Emergency Call Bypass Method?"></a>Part 1: What Is the Emergency Call Bypass Method?</h2><p>The <strong>Android emergency call bypass</strong> method is a lesser-known workaround for those unfortunate moments when you’re locked out of your phone. This method exploits a loophole in the phone’s lock screen, allowing you to access your device even when you’ve <a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/9-ways-to-bypass-samsung-lock-screen-pattern-pin-password-fingerprint.html"><u>forgotten your password, PIN, or pattern</u></a>. It’s like finding a secret backdoor when the front door is bolted shut.</p><p><strong>“How can unlocking Vivo, Oppo, and Samsung phones using emergency calls</strong> be effective?” You may ask. Imagine you need to access important information on your phone but can’t remember your lock screen code. Instead of panicking or rushing to a technician, the emergency call bypass can be a quick and handy solution. It’s particularly useful when immediate access to your phone is crucial and you don’t have time to <a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/reset-android/how-to-reset-privacy-password-in-oppo.html"><u>reset your password </u></a> through official channels.</p><h3 id="Limitations-of-the-Emergency-Call-Bypass-Method"><a href="#Limitations-of-the-Emergency-Call-Bypass-Method" class="headerlink" title="Limitations of the Emergency Call Bypass Method"></a>Limitations of the Emergency Call Bypass Method</h3><p>However, it’s important to note that this method has its limitations. It primarily works on older Android devices, specifically those running Android 5.0 (Lollipop) and below. As smartphone technology has evolved, manufacturers have patched many loopholes to enhance security. So, this method might not work for you if you have a more recent Android version.</p><p>But don’t worry – if you’re locked out of a newer phone, you can try several other methods, which you will explore later in this article. Remember, the <strong>emergency call bypass</strong> can be a lifesaver in specific scenarios. However, it’s always best to use such methods responsibly and ethically. And, of course, you should always note your passwords.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/unlock-emergency-call-phone-02.jpg"                      alt="android emergency screen"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-To-Perform-Emergency-Call-Bypass-To-Unlock-Screen"><a href="#Part-2-How-To-Perform-Emergency-Call-Bypass-To-Unlock-Screen" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How To Perform Emergency Call Bypass To Unlock Screen"></a>Part 2: How To Perform Emergency Call Bypass To Unlock Screen</h2><p>Unlocking your Android phone without a password using the Emergency Call Bypass method can be tricky, but it’s doable, especially on devices running Android OS 5.0 (Lollipop) and below. Here’s a step-by-step guide on <strong>how to unlock any phone password using the emergency call</strong> feature:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Start by tapping the <strong>Emergency Call</strong> button on your lock screen.

It allows you to unlock your phone bootloader. A bootloader or bootstrap loader gathers the operating system files, loads them into memory, and hands over control, essentially starting your device. Unlocking the bootloader assists you in installing custom ROMs, flashing custom kernels, and rooting your phone.</p><p>However, this freedom comes with some trade-offs. Most manufacturers will void your warranty if you unlock the bootloader, and it can also make your phone face higher risks of malware and other security threats. Additionally, it can be difficult to relock the bootloader once you unlock it.</p><p>If you encounter the <strong>OEM unlock missing</strong> on your Android phone despite wanting to unlock your bootloader, this article can help. You will learn the step-by-step guide for the different methods to fix the <strong>missing OEM unlock</strong> option. Before diving into solutions, let’s explore why this option might be unavailable in the first place.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/oem-unlock-missing-01.jpg"                      alt="using a phone at work"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-Why-Is-OEM-Unlock-Missing-on-Your-Device"><a href="#Part-1-Why-Is-OEM-Unlock-Missing-on-Your-Device" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Why Is OEM Unlock Missing on Your Device?"></a>Part 1: Why Is OEM Unlock Missing on Your Device?</h2><p>Finding that OEM Unlock is missing on your Android phones can be frustrating, particularly if you plan to modify your software or install a custom ROM. But don’t worry. There are several possible explanations for this. Let’s explore some of the most common reasons:</p><p>Manufacturer Restrictions</p><p>The <strong>Missing OEM Unlock</strong> option can often be due to restrictions imposed by your device’s manufacturers. They may intentionally remove this option to safeguard device security and compatibility. It is common with carrier-locked devices. As a result, the OEM Unlock option may not show.</p><p>Bootloader Already Unlocked</p><p>In some cases, the <strong>Android OEM Unlock Missing</strong> issue arises <a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/how-to-unlock-xiaomi-bootloader.html"><u>when the bootloader has already been unlocked</u></a>. Relocking the bootloader might make the option reappear. But exercise caution as this process can erase device data.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/oem-unlock-missing-02.jpg"                      alt="oem unlock option greyed out"                ></p><p>Developer Options Not Enabled</p><p>It might seem obvious, but sometimes the simplest things get overlooked. The OEM Unlock option can only be accessed from within Developer Options. If this menu isn’t enabled, you won’t see it.</p><p>Carrier-Locked Devices</p><p>The <strong>OEM Unlock Missing</strong> issue can also occur if your device is <a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/sim-unlock/carrier-unlock-android-phone.html"><u>carrier-locked</u></a>. Carriers often impose restrictions to prevent users from switching networks, and bootloader unlocking is one way to do that. Unfortunately, the <strong>missing OEM Unlock</strong> option is usually intentional, and unlocking your device can be more complicated.</p><p>Security Features</p><p>Enhanced security features, like Samsung’s KNOX, can sometimes conceal the OEM Unlock option. Temporarily turning off these features might show the option, but it’s crucial to be aware of the potential security implications of doing so.</p><p>Corrupted Bootloader</p><p>A corrupted bootloader can also lead to the <strong>Android OEM Unlock missing</strong> problem. The bootloader plays a role in the boot process, and if it’s damaged, it might not display the necessary options. This can be caused by software glitches, failed flashing attempts, or even <a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/device-diagnostics/how-to-run-a-hardware-test-on-xiaomi.html"><u>hardware issues</u></a>. In this scenario, you might need to consult your device’s manufacturer or a technical specialist to help repair or re-flash the bootloader.</p><p>Connectivity Issues</p><p>A poor connection between your device and computer can also prevent the OEM Unlocking from showing up. Check your cables and try using different USB ports to ensure a stable connection.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-To-Enable-Missing-OEM-Unlock-Without-a-Password"><a href="#Part-2-How-To-Enable-Missing-OEM-Unlock-Without-a-Password" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How To Enable Missing OEM Unlock Without a Password?"></a>Part 2: How To Enable Missing OEM Unlock Without a Password?</h2><p>Unlocking your phone’s bootloader (OEM Unlock) varies across models and brands. Some need a passcode or PIN after rebooting the phone, while others don’t. Even if your phone doesn’t require a separate password, your existing screen lock (password, PIN, pattern) will usually be needed to enable the <strong>missing OEM unlock</strong> option.</p><p>But what if you forgot that, too? <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/"><u>Wondershare Dr.Fone</u></a> - Screen Unlock can help bypass forgotten passwords and unlock your phone even if you don’t have the technical knowledge.

For these phones, unlocking the SIM card becomes crucial before you can toggle the OEM unlock option. Here are the steps to fix the <strong>OEM Unlock missing</strong> or greyed out using SIM card removal:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Use the SIM ejector tool (often included with your phone) or a small pin to push the tray out.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Go to <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>General Management</strong> &gt; <strong>Reset</strong>, then select <strong>Factory data reset</strong>. Enter your PIN or password if needed.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/oem-unlock-missing-14.jpg"                      alt="android factory data reset"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Review the warning and tap <strong>Reset</strong> to confirm.</li><li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Once the reset is complete, your phone will restart. Connect to Wi-Fi when prompted.</li><li><strong>Step 5:</strong> Skip any prompts to log in to your Google or email account. Then, repeat the process to open the <strong>Developer Options</strong> in the previous sections.</li></ul><h2 id="Conclusion-1"><a href="#Conclusion-1" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Having the <strong>OEM Unlock missing</strong> or greyed out can leave Android users feeling locked out of customization possibilities. Fortunately, this article has outlined helpful solutions like enabling the <strong>Android OEM Unlock missing</strong> option via the Developer Options. You can also try other methods above, like adjusting date and time settings or even a sim card removal trick. For those facing forgotten lock screens, we’ve offered guidance on bypassing them using the Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock tool to access the necessary phone settings.</p><p>While these methods provide a solid foundation, it’s always wise to research steps specific to your phone model.

Here’s How You Can Unlock Asus ROG Phone 7 Ultimate Pattern Lock Screen</h2><p>Forgetting the pattern lock of a device and getting locked out of it is probably one of the most frustrating scenarios faced by Android users. Nevertheless, unlike popular operating systems, Android provides a seamless way to past the forgot pattern lock feature.</p><p>You can either try Google’s native solution or a third-party tool in case you have forgotten the pattern lock on your device and reset it. In no time, you will be able to access your device (or even someone else’s phone by following these techniques). To make things easier for you, we have provided three simple solutions to resolve forgotten patterns on Android devices.</p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/68FqgS6Ym8E" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-bypass-forgot-pattern-lock-using-the-‘Forgot-Pattern’-feature"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-bypass-forgot-pattern-lock-using-the-‘Forgot-Pattern’-feature" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to bypass forgot pattern lock using the ‘Forgot Pattern’ feature?"></a>Part 1: How to bypass forgot pattern lock using the ‘Forgot Pattern’ feature?</h2><p>One of the easiest and fastest ways to fix the forgot pattern lock issue on a device is by using its inbuilt “Forgot Pattern” feature. If you are using an Android 4.4 or earlier version, then you can simply access this feature. Since users can hack an Android device just by knowing the Google credentials of the connected device, the solution was later discontinued (as it was considered a security vulnerability). Nevertheless, if your device hasn’t been updated and you are using an Android 4.4 or previous version, then you can bypass the forgot pattern lock by following these steps:</p><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Firstly, provide the wrong pattern to your device. It will let you know that you applied the incorrect pattern.</p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> On the same prompt, you can see an option of “Forgot pattern” on the bottom. Simply tap on it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/09/15059289368742.jpg"                      alt="forgot pattern"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3.</strong> This will open a new screen, which can be used to bypass the forgotten pattern of Android. Select the option for entering the Google Account details and proceed.</p><p><strong>Step 4.</strong> To reset the forgot pattern lock, you need to provide the correct Google credentials of the account already linked to the Asus ROG Phone 7 Ultimate device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/09/15059290192675.jpg"                      alt="enter google account"                ></p><p><strong>Step 5.</strong> After signing in to the interface, you will be asked to provide a new pattern lock for the Asus ROG Phone 7 Ultimate device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/09/15059290477717.jpg"                      alt="draw an unlock pattern"                ></p><p><strong>Step 6.</strong> Confirm your choice and set a new pattern lock on your device.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-get-past-forgot-pattern-lock-using-Dr-Fone-Screen-Unlock-Android"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-get-past-forgot-pattern-lock-using-Dr-Fone-Screen-Unlock-Android" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to get past forgot pattern lock using Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (Android)?"></a>Part 2: How to get past forgot pattern lock using Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (Android)?</h2><p>One of the major drawbacks of the “Forgot pattern” feature is that it doesn’t work on new Android devices.

However, pattern locks are easy to crack, and today, we bring you all you want to know about pattern locks and how to create a <strong>hard pattern lock</strong>. Further to this, we also tell you how to move beyond pattern locks and what to do in case you forgot the hard pattern lock you just set and are unable to unlock your smartphone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/09/hard-pattern-lock-1.jpg"                      alt="creating more secure pattern locks"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-You-Need-to-Know-About-Pattern-Locks"><a href="#Part-1-What-You-Need-to-Know-About-Pattern-Locks" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What You Need to Know About Pattern Locks"></a>Part 1: What You Need to Know About Pattern Locks</h2><p>Pattern lock is an Android-only feature that makes it easy for users to have a modicum of security on their smartphones. Most users do not prefer using and remembering a PIN to unlock the smartphone. Creating a pattern makes it easier, somehow.</p><p>There is a 9-point grid on which you swipe your finger from point to point, in any direction, and when you take your finger off, that pattern you swiped becomes the key to unlock your smartphone.</p><p>Pattern locks were exceedingly common only a few years ago, and they are not recommended for use any longer due to concerns (mentioned later in the article).</p><h3 id="1-1-Popularity-and-Usage"><a href="#1-1-Popularity-and-Usage" class="headerlink" title="1.1: Popularity and Usage"></a>1.1: Popularity and Usage</h3><p>Old habits die hard, or so they say, right? That’s because it is true. We are creatures of habit, and pattern locks have been around for a long, long time. We are accustomed to pattern locks. So, even with even easier technologies such as fingerprint recognition and face recognition, we tend to gravitate towards the familiar old pattern lock.</p><p>The only thing is, there is a reason why pattern locks are no longer the preferred option to use for unlocking your smartphones. As it happens, that reason is security, and it can be very easy for humans to take a swipe (pardon the pun) at your pattern lock. And guess what? The research conducted suggests that they would get it right with an unsettling accuracy.</p><h3 id="1-2-Advantages-and-Drawbacks"><a href="#1-2-Advantages-and-Drawbacks" class="headerlink" title="1.2: Advantages and Drawbacks"></a>1.2: Advantages and Drawbacks</h3><p>With on-the-go lifestyles, our smartphones have become indispensable and contain some of the most sensitive aspects of our lives – IDs, credit and debit cards in digital wallets, photo and video memories, business documents – you name it, the smartphones have it, on the go. This has opened our lives up to the public at large, and if someone steals our smartphone or, best case, finds it, the only barrier preventing them from being privy to all that wealth of our sensitive information is that screen lock – the pattern lock that we set on our smartphones. That’s it – the single pattern lock stands between malicious actors and our data. You might be beginning to realize just how crazy this is.</p><h4 id="Advantages-of-Pattern-Locks"><a href="#Advantages-of-Pattern-Locks" class="headerlink" title="Advantages of Pattern Locks"></a>Advantages of Pattern Locks</h4><p>There are two advantages to using pattern locks. One, they are better than nothing. Two, they are easy to use. And that’s about it. There is no third advantage to pattern locks. We might think we set a hard pattern lock that nobody could guess, but, as research proves, we might be thinking too low of human prowess.</p><h4 id="Disadvantages-of-Pattern-Locks"><a href="#Disadvantages-of-Pattern-Locks" class="headerlink" title="Disadvantages of Pattern Locks"></a>Disadvantages of Pattern Locks</h4><p>Security, or rather, the lack of it, is the lone disadvantage of using a pattern lock. What good is a pattern lock that can be easily deciphered? Sure, they are easy to use, and they are better than not having anything, but would you really want to protect your life’s data with something that could be, as researchers found out, breached in under 5 attempts? We don’t think you do!</p><p>The research found that 64% of test subjects who were shown videos of people unlocking their phones could correctly guess a 6-point pattern lock, that too after viewing the video only once! That number shot up to 80% if they were allowed to see the video again. That is simply astounding and a nightmare for security. When it comes to PINs, only 11% could guess a 6-digit PIN after viewing the unlocking video once, and that number shot up to 27% when they could see the video two times.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-To-Create-a-Hard-Pattern-Lock-Including-Remembering-Complex-Patterns"><a href="#Part-2-How-To-Create-a-Hard-Pattern-Lock-Including-Remembering-Complex-Patterns" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How To Create a Hard Pattern Lock (Including Remembering Complex Patterns)"></a>Part 2: How To Create a Hard Pattern Lock (Including Remembering Complex Patterns)</h2><p>Now, if you must continue using a pattern lock, let’s help you know how to create a hard pattern lock that would not be as easy to decipher as easy pattern locks. For that, you should know how people use pattern locks, the kind of pattern locks they create, and the ones that are the most commonly used pattern locks. That way, you can avoid those fallacies and create a hard pattern lock for your smartphone.</p><h3 id="2-1-The-Pattern-Locks-People-Use-Most-Commonly"><a href="#2-1-The-Pattern-Locks-People-Use-Most-Commonly" class="headerlink" title="2.1: The Pattern Locks People Use Most Commonly"></a>2.1: The Pattern Locks People Use Most Commonly</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/09/hard-pattern-lock-2.jpg"                      alt="common pattern locks"                ></p><p>Marte Loge, an M.Sc. Computer Science student, gave a presentation on pattern locks at DEFCON 23 and made a bold claim. She said, “Tell me who you are, and I will tell you your lock pattern.”</p><p>She presented the following statistics to support her claim:</p><ul><li>- In her research, she found that 77% of people started with one of the 4 corners when creating a pattern lock.</li><li>- 44% of people started with the top-left dot and 15% with the top-right, while the bottom-left was preferred by 14% of her test subjects.</li><li>- People set 5-point pattern locks on average, and most users were content with a 4-point pattern.</li></ul><p>These are some of the most common pattern locks people create:</p><ul><li>- patterns in the shapes of alphabets,</li><li>- patterns in the shapes of numerals,</li><li>- patterns in any other simple shape, such as square, triangle, star, etc.</li></ul><p>To understand how this is a security nightmare, the possible combinations for a 4-point pattern are a measly 1624, whereas by adding just 1 more point to the pattern and creating a 5-point pattern, the number of possible combinations becomes 7152, an increase of 5528 combinations. In stark contrast, creating a 9-point pattern would give you over 140,000 possible combinations!</p><h3 id="2-2-How-to-Create-a-Hard-Pattern-Lock"><a href="#2-2-How-to-Create-a-Hard-Pattern-Lock" class="headerlink" title="2.2: How to Create a Hard Pattern Lock"></a>2.2: How to Create a Hard Pattern Lock</h3><p>Knowing what most people do when creating a pattern lock, it becomes easy to avoid those mistakes and instead create a hard pattern lock for oneself.</p><ul><li>- Do not start creating a pattern lock from any of the 4 corners of the grid.</li><li>- Never use your first initial as your pattern lock.</li><li>- Never use the shape of a numeral as your pattern lock.</li><li>- Use all 9 points on the grid to create your pattern lock, and contrary to popular belief, you can go over the connecting lines several times, creating a hard pattern lock that would not be as easy for people to decipher!</li></ul><h2 id="Part-3-Going-Beyond-Pattern-Locks"><a href="#Part-3-Going-Beyond-Pattern-Locks" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Going Beyond Pattern Locks"></a>Part 3: Going Beyond Pattern Locks</h2><p>You might think that now that you have set a hard pattern lock, you are good to go.

Using fingerprint recognition requires you to set a 6-digit PIN and then set a fingerprint to unlock your device. You can set additional fingerprints, too.</p><p>This way, your device is the most secure it can be today. In case your fingerprint is not recognized for any reason, the phone falls back on the 6-digit PIN that you can enter and unlock your phone.</p><p>While face recognition is available on both Android and Apple devices, it is truly secure only on Apple devices. This is why Apple iPhones released after the iPhone X in 2017 have come only with Face ID. They fall back on a minimum 6-digit PIN (called Passcode in Apple world) to unlock in case the face does not get recognized in the first attempt.</p><h2 id="Part-4-How-To-Unlock-Phone-If-Hard-Pattern-Lock-Forgotten"><a href="#Part-4-How-To-Unlock-Phone-If-Hard-Pattern-Lock-Forgotten" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How To Unlock Phone If Hard Pattern Lock Forgotten"></a>Part 4: How To Unlock Phone If Hard Pattern Lock Forgotten</h2><p>Just in case you set a hard pattern lock and promptly forgot that abstruse pattern you just set, we have a tool for you to quickly unlock your phone in case of a forgotten hard pattern lock: Wondershare Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://drfone.wondershare.com/style/images/arrow_up.png"                      alt="arrow"                ></p><h3 id="Dr-Fone-Screen-Unlock-Android-1"><a href="#Dr-Fone-Screen-Unlock-Android-1" class="headerlink" title="Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (Android)"></a><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare-dr-fone-unlock-android-screen/" >Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (Android) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>Remove the Hard Pattern Lock on Your Asus ROG Phone 7 If You Forgot!</p><ul><li>Remove all Android screen locks (PIN&#x2F;pattern&#x2F;fingerprints&#x2F;face ID) in minutes.</li><li>Bypass the FRP lock of Samsung without a PIN or Google account.</li><li>Everyone can handle the lock screen without any tech knowledge.</li><li>Provide specific removal solutions to promise good success rate.</li></ul><p><strong>4,008,671</strong> people have downloaded it</p><p>Download the latest version of Dr.Fone from the Wondershare website and launch the app.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png"                      alt="drfone app"                ></p><p>Step 1: Click Android under Toolbox &gt; Screen Unlock.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/select-your-mobile-device-to-unlock.png"                      alt="drfone android screen unlock"                ></p><p>Step 2: Click Unlock Android Screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/android-screen-unlock-3.png"                      alt="drfone screen unlock android"                ></p><p>Step 3: Select your device manufacturer.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/screen-unlock-any-android-device-2.png"                      alt="drfone screen unlock manufacturer selection"                ></p><p>Step 4: Prepare your device to unlock the screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/unlock-android-screen-google.png"                      alt="wipe partition cache instructions"                ></p><p>When the greyed Next button becomes available, click it and wait for your device to be unlocked.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/screen-unlock-any-android-device-6.png"                      alt="screen unlock successful"                ></p><p>All data on the Asus ROG Phone 7 device is wiped under this method.

Android seems to be controlling a considerably high portion of our life. We have bought many gadgets that use this amazing OS and most of which are phones. But how much can you do with your Android phone? Developers are always making it more interesting to use this interface.</p><p>Most of the time, we use Android phones, we get faced with the need to access the internet. The Wi-Fi capability of these Android gadgets makes it super easy for us to surf the web. Throughout using Wi-Fi, we connect to a number of them. This could be at school, a sub-way café, the gym, buses, hospitals, hotels, towns, and the list is endless. A password secures most of this. Needless to say, our brain is weak to store all these passwords for future use, especially if you would want to connect with a different gadget you have recently bought or even your laptop. In this article, we will introduce you to how to find wifi password on rooted and also unrooted Android devices.</p><iframe allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/78mNMIr_wpI"></iframe><h2 id="Part-1-Show-Wifi-Password-on-Rooted-Android-Device"><a href="#Part-1-Show-Wifi-Password-on-Rooted-Android-Device" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Show Wifi Password on Rooted Android Device"></a>Part 1: Show Wifi Password on Rooted Android Device</h2><h3 id="What-is-Rooting"><a href="#What-is-Rooting" class="headerlink" title="What is Rooting?"></a>What is Rooting?</h3><p>First of all, what does rooting mean? You have probably used a Windows computer or even Linux. For the case of Windows, when installing a new program or software, it always prompts a dialog box saying, “Administrator permission required to run this program.” If you don’t have the administrator permission, you won’t install the program. In Android, this is called rooting. In simple terms, it means having the root permission to your phone. Some Android apps will require you the root permission, e.g., flashing your ROM. In this part, we will explain how you can show the Wi-Fi password on your Android with root.</p><p>To find the Wi-Fi passwords on your Android phone, you need to have an app to explore files which also supports a root user. In this case, ES FileExplorer or Root Explorer will come in handy. However, it turns out that the latter is offered at $3. Let’s use the free ES File Explorer.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14556285763404.jpg"                      alt="android show wifi password"                ></p><h3 id="Steps-of-getting-Wi-Fi-password-on-Android-with-root"><a href="#Steps-of-getting-Wi-Fi-password-on-Android-with-root" class="headerlink" title="Steps of getting Wi-Fi password on Android with root"></a>Steps of getting Wi-Fi password on Android with root</h3><p>In only four steps, we, at this moment, learn how we can find the password of a Wi-Fi on an Android phone.</p><p>Step 1: Install the ES File Explorer</p><p>Download the ES File Explorer from your play store, install it, and open it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14556286507084.jpg"                      alt="android show wifi password"                ></p><p>Step 2: Enable Root Explorer</p><p>The root explorer needs to be enabled so that you can reach the root folders of the Wi-Fi passwords you need. By default, the root feature in this ES explorer is not enabled. To enable it, just tap on the list menu on the top left corner.:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14556292611536.jpg"                      alt="android show wifi password"                ></p><p>This will drop down a list of controls. Scroll down and find the <strong>Root Explorer</strong> option and enable it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14556293052566.jpg"                      alt="android show wifi password"                ></p><p>Step 3: Get the passwords’ file.</p><p>Go back to ES file explorer, and this time, find the folder named <strong>data</strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14556293412707.jpg"                      alt="android show wifi password"                ></p><p>When this folder opens, find another one named <strong>misc</strong>. Open it and find another one named <strong>wifi</strong>. Here, find a file named <strong>wpa_supplicant.conf</strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14556293762552.jpg"                      alt="android show wifi password"                ></p><p>Step 4: Retrieve the wifi password on Android</p><p>Make sure that you don’t edit anything in the file. You might mess up with important data and fail to access the Wi-Fi(s) in the future.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14556294042257.jpg"                      alt="android show wifi password"                ></p><p>As you can see above, we have found the Wi-Fi passwords on the android device. On each network profile, we have the name of the network represented by <em>name (ssid&#x3D;”{the name}”)</em>, the network’s password represented by <em>psk</em>, the network’s access point represented by <em>key_mgmt&#x3D;WPA-PSK</em> and its priority represented by <em>priority</em>.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Show-Wifi-Password-on-Android-without-Root"><a href="#Part-2-Show-Wifi-Password-on-Android-without-Root" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Show Wifi Password on Android without Root"></a>Part 2: Show Wifi Password on Android without Root</h2><p>What if I don’t have root access to my Android, can I still see Android Wi-Fi password? The short answer is yes. However, this is a bit involving but simple. You don’t need to be a computer guru to do it, but you need to have a computer and some internet access of course. The key thing is to find a way through which we can fetch the password file from the phone without using a root access protocol in the Android. This is made possible by some little programming insight using the Windows Command prompt.</p><h3 id="Steps-to-show-Wi-Fi-password-on-Android-without-root"><a href="#Steps-to-show-Wi-Fi-password-on-Android-without-root" class="headerlink" title="Steps to show Wi-Fi password on Android without root"></a>Steps to show Wi-Fi password on Android without root</h3><p>Step 1: Access the Developer authority</p><p>To access the files that Android uses to run passwords, you must first become a developer. This is very simple.</p><p>Get your Android phone and go to settings. Scroll down and find “About phone.” Tap on it and scroll down again to find Build number.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14556302638925.jpg"                      alt="android show wifi password"                ></p><p>Tap on this “build number” 5 to 6 times until a message pops up, saying, “You are now a developer”.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14556303263992.jpg"                      alt="android show wifi password"                ></p><p>Step 2: Enable the debugging.</p><p>Go back to Settings. Scroll down for developer options. Turn on the button for “Android&#x2F;USB debugging”.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14556308665697.jpg"                      alt="android show wifi password"                ></p><p>Step 3: Install ADB drivers.</p><p>Now, open your Windows desktop. Download and install ADB drivers. (Use this download link <a class="link"   href="http://adbdriver.com/" >adbdriver.com <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>). You need to download and install platform tools (minimal ADB and fastboot) from <a class="link"   href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2317790" >http://forum.xda-developers.com/... <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> Now open the folder where you’ve installed the above tools. By default, it is in the Local disc <em>C\windows\system32\platform_tools</em> location. However, you might want to locate them by searching on the windows search engine. You have to hold the Shift key and right-click inside the folder to click on”Open Command Window Here.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14556329561742.jpg"                      alt="android show wifi password"                ></p><p>Step 4: Test the ADB</p><p>Here, we would like to test whether the ABD is working properly. To do this, connect your phone to the PC using a USB. In the command prompt, type <strong>adb services</strong> and then press enter. If it’s working properly, you should see a device on this list.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14556329984622.jpg"                      alt="android show wifi password"                ></p><p>Step 5: Find the Android wifi password.</p><p>Now, it is time to type the given command in the command prompt and type: <em>adb pull &#x2F;data&#x2F;misc&#x2F;wifi&#x2F;wpa_supplicant.conf c:&#x2F;wpa_supplicant.conf</em>. This will fetch the file from your phone to the local disc C drive of the PC.</p><p>Step 6: Get the wifi passwords.</p><p>Lastly, open the file with a notepad, and there you go.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14556331232772.jpg"                      alt="android show wifi password"                ></p><p>Now you learned how to show the wifi password on your Android device.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins><br><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://android-unlock.techidaily.com/how-to-fix-oem-unlock-missing-on-samsung-galaxy-f04-by-drfone-android/"><u>How To Fix OEM Unlock Missing on Samsung Galaxy F04?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-top-10-password-cracking-tools-for-vivo-x-flip-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, Top 10 Password Cracking Tools For Vivo X Flip</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-unlock.techidaily.com/a-perfect-guide-to-remove-or-disable-google-smart-lock-on-samsung-galaxy-m34-5g-by-drfone-android/"><u>A Perfect Guide To Remove or Disable Google Smart Lock On Samsung Galaxy M34 5G</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-unlock.techidaily.com/still-using-pattern-locks-with-samsung-galaxy-a24-tips-tricks-and-helpful-advice-by-drfone-android/"><u>Still Using Pattern Locks with Samsung Galaxy A24?

To reach the lock screen settings android, you’ve to follow the path:</p><p>Options – Security – Screen Lock – Choose Screen Lock.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/android-lock-screen-settings-1.jpg"                      alt="android lock screen settings"                ></p><p>Now see how to unlock your lock screen in different ways.</p><h3 id="1-Slide"><a href="#1-Slide" class="headerlink" title="1.Slide"></a>1.Slide</h3><p>This is the most common method of unlocking an android lock screen. On all most all the android device, you’ll notice a lock mostly on the right side (sometimes on top) of a round charm. You just have to direct towards the lock and then the lock screen will be unlocked in no time. This method doesn’t provide any security (it just protects your device from sudden access by tapping on screen or any of the button) to your device as no password or PIN is required to set the “Slide” unlock.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/android-lock-screen-settings-3.jpg"                      alt="android lock screen settings"                ></p><p>Keep your any finger on the middle of the round charm and by keeping your finger pressed, reach on the lock icon. The lock screen will be unlocked just after reaching your finger to the lock icon.</p><h3 id="2-Face-Unlock"><a href="#2-Face-Unlock" class="headerlink" title="2.Face Unlock"></a>2.Face Unlock</h3><p>This method of unlocking your lock screen needs your Android device to snap a photo of your with its camera. After you set the snapped photo as the unlocking recognition, you could unlock your device through showing your face on the screen.</p><p>Capture a picture of your face with your Android device’s camera and then set it for logging in into your device. From the lock screen, by just by holding your face, you can log in. It’s very interesting, but you should never rely on this method for strong security as this method of unlocking is prone to break easily as an intruder can unlock your device by putting a photo of you in front of your device. Moreover, this method sometimes doesn’t work properly. So it’s better to go for some other highly secured options for locking your screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/android-lock-screen-settings-4.jpg"                      alt="android lock screen settings"                ></p><h3 id="3-Pattern"><a href="#3-Pattern" class="headerlink" title="3.Pattern"></a>3.Pattern</h3><p>This is a way of setting pattern for lock screen from a grid of nine dots. You can select the pattern like some letter like Z, L or C etc, but nothing guarantees high security as the set pattern can be easily guessed or be seen while you are unlocking your device. Another problem is that by unlocking with the same pattern, your finger leaves some marks for the pattern’s path. By following the path, a stranger can unlock your device. So for little security, you can use pattern unlock method on your Android device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/android-lock-screen-settings-5.jpg"                      alt="android lock screen settings"                ></p><p>Go to the lock screen setting for Pattern and then set the pattern by sliding your finger from one dot to another, then another and like that way. Remember which pattern you’ve set in order to unlock your device in the next time.</p><h3 id="4-PIN"><a href="#4-PIN" class="headerlink" title="4.PIN"></a>4.PIN</h3><p>You might be troubled by thinking about the difference between PIN and Password. A little distinction is there for a PIN and that is it consists of numbers only whereas for password, you can associate some alphabetical letters or signs along with numbers.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/android-lock-screen-settings-6.jpg"                      alt="android lock screen settings"                ></p><p>Go to the lock screen setting for PIN and then set a PIN that consists of minimum 4 digits. It’s your choice to use 4 or more digit PIN. After setting the PIN, you can access your Android device by putting the PIN in a box from the lock screen. PIN protected lock screen is highly protected if the PIN is set strongly.</p><h3 id="5-Password"><a href="#5-Password" class="headerlink" title="5.Password"></a>5.Password</h3><p>In addition to PIN protection, you can consider it as password by adding some letters, special characters with the previously selected PIN codes. It’s also very much highly protected method of locking screen though you might be bored with tapping for the password again and again. But never ignore the value of your device’s files, so a password can be a well-sought lock screen protection for many users.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/android-lock-screen-settings-7.jpg"                      alt="android lock screen settings"                ></p><h3 id="6-Fingerprint"><a href="#6-Fingerprint" class="headerlink" title="6.Fingerprint"></a>6.Fingerprint</h3><p>In some of the modern Android device, you’ll find the feature of fingerprint unlocking. You can find the option through the screen or any dedicated button. By setting your fingerprint, you can unlock your device by tapping your finger on the Sony Xperia 5 V device’s screen or the dedicated button.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/android-lock-screen-settings-8.jpg"                      alt="android lock screen settings"                ></p><h3 id="7-Voice"><a href="#7-Voice" class="headerlink" title="7.Voice"></a>7.Voice</h3><p>This is also a fun way of unlocking Android lock screen as you can unlock by saying the same voice that you’ve saved as the unlocking recognition.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/android-lock-screen-settings-9.jpg"                      alt="android lock screen settings"                ></p><p>Go to the setting from “Voice Unlock” button and record your voice such as “Open My Sony Xperia 5 V” or as per your choice with clear sound. Repeat the voice a few more times as to match well. Then set and unlock your device from the lock screen by using the same voice command.</p><h2 id="Customize-Android-Lock-Screen"><a href="#Customize-Android-Lock-Screen" class="headerlink" title="Customize Android Lock Screen"></a>Customize Android Lock Screen</h2><p><strong>Lock Screen Widgets</strong></p><p>Widgets can be used from Android lock screen without unlocking the Sony Xperia 5 V device first.
