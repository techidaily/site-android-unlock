It can’t recognize your face. When you try multiple times in such cases, it will lock your device permanently. Are you stuck with a locked phone? And you’re still confused about what just happened. Face unlock may face problems such as</p><ul><li>Face unlock app may be buggy</li><li>Your face unlock settings may be unstable</li><li>Your phone camera or face unlock sensor may be damaged</li><li>Someone else may have registered their face without your permission</li></ul><p>Whatever the reason, they are equally big obstacles for you to use your phone as usual; trying to unlock your device can lead to a permanently locked phone. So how do you bypass face unlock?</p><p>Follow the guide below to bypass the face unlock settings and choose the best one for yourself.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/face-unlock-android-1.jpg"                      alt="face lock"                ></p><h2 id="How-To-Bypass-Android-Face-Lock-by-Ourselves"><a href="#How-To-Bypass-Android-Face-Lock-by-Ourselves" class="headerlink" title="How To Bypass Android Face Lock by Ourselves?"></a>How To Bypass Android Face Lock by Ourselves?</h2><p>If you want to bypass face lock by yourself, then different methods can help you. These are all tested and work well.</p><h3 id="1-A-Picture-Possibly-Bypasses-Face-Lock"><a href="#1-A-Picture-Possibly-Bypasses-Face-Lock" class="headerlink" title="1.

A Picture Possibly Bypasses Face Lock</h3><p>You can use your photo to manipulate the face lock app. Simply use your photo to unlock the phone, which should work fine. If your phone doesn’t recognize your face from a photo, try again.</p><p>If it still doesn’t recognize your face, try a different photo or even change the camera’s lighting settings or the angles to see if that helps.</p><p>Anyway, this method is still unstable because of many uncontrollable factors. If everything fails, consider the following methods to bypass the face lock.</p><h3 id="2-Hard-Reset-your-phone"><a href="#2-Hard-Reset-your-phone" class="headerlink" title="2. Hard Reset your phone"></a>2. Hard Reset your phone</h3><p>To get around the Android lock screen, perform a factory reset. While resetting your phone allows you to set a new password, it also erases all data from your device. This method works like a charm, but it also requires more technical knowledge. To bypass screen lock via factory reset, follow these steps.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/face-unlock-android-2.jpg"                      alt="android hard reset"                ></p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Turn off your phone and hold the Power and Volume-down buttons simultaneously until the recovery mode screen appears. There are minor variations depending on the brand and model.</p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Select the Wipe data&#x2F;Factory Reset option using the volume buttons. To confirm the option, press the Power button.</p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Choose Yes &gt; Delete All User Data, then press the power button to continue. When the process is complete, turn on your phone.</p><p>So, before facing such awkward cases, like data loss, we suggest you have a backup habit of keeping your data safe.</p><h3 id="3-Google-Find-My-Device"><a href="#3-Google-Find-My-Device" class="headerlink" title="3. Google Find My Device"></a>3. Google Find My Device</h3><p>Google Find My Device is a service that lets you remotely lock, track, and wipe data from stolen or lost phones. With a Google account and the password, it won’t be complicated to remove any locks on your phone. You can bypass the Android lock screen by following the steps below:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/face-unlock-android-3.jpg"                      alt="google find my device data reset"                ></p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Navigate to Find My Device and sign in with your Google account.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Your phone receives a notification.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Select Erase Device, confirm, and click Erase as a warning pops up on the screen.</p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> The factory reset process on your phone begins. When it’s finished, choose My Google Account instead of using your phone as if it were brand new.</p><p>Just like the hard reset, after using Google Find My Device, all your data and settings will be erased. Please make everything well prepared before you decide to unlock your device.</p><h2 id="Easiest-Way-to-Unlock-Your-Android-Face-Recognition-Using-Dr-Fone-Screen-unlock"><a href="#Easiest-Way-to-Unlock-Your-Android-Face-Recognition-Using-Dr-Fone-Screen-unlock" class="headerlink" title="Easiest Way to Unlock Your Android Face Recognition Using Dr.Fone-Screen unlock"></a>Easiest Way to Unlock Your Android Face Recognition Using Dr.Fone-Screen unlock</h2><p>The methods mentioned above may be hard for you, and you don’t know any technical skills.

It can’t recognize your face. When you try multiple times in such cases, it will lock your device permanently. Are you stuck with a locked phone? And you’re still confused about what just happened. Face unlock may face problems such as</p><ul><li>Face unlock app may be buggy</li><li>Your face unlock settings may be unstable</li><li>Your phone camera or face unlock sensor may be damaged</li><li>Someone else may have registered their face without your permission</li></ul><p>Whatever the reason, they are equally big obstacles for you to use your phone as usual; trying to unlock your device can lead to a permanently locked phone. So how do you bypass face unlock?</p><p>Follow the guide below to bypass the face unlock settings and choose the best one for yourself.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/face-unlock-android-1.jpg"                      alt="face lock"                ></p><h2 id="How-To-Bypass-Android-Face-Lock-by-Ourselves"><a href="#How-To-Bypass-Android-Face-Lock-by-Ourselves" class="headerlink" title="How To Bypass Android Face Lock by Ourselves?"></a>How To Bypass Android Face Lock by Ourselves?</h2><p>If you want to bypass face lock by yourself, then different methods can help you. These are all tested and work well.</p><h3 id="1-A-Picture-Possibly-Bypasses-Face-Lock"><a href="#1-A-Picture-Possibly-Bypasses-Face-Lock" class="headerlink" title="1. A Picture Possibly Bypasses Face Lock"></a>1. A Picture Possibly Bypasses Face Lock</h3><p>You can use your photo to manipulate the face lock app. Simply use your photo to unlock the phone, which should work fine. If your phone doesn’t recognize your face from a photo, try again.</p><p>If it still doesn’t recognize your face, try a different photo or even change the camera’s lighting settings or the angles to see if that helps.</p><p>Anyway, this method is still unstable because of many uncontrollable factors. If everything fails, consider the following methods to bypass the face lock.</p><h3 id="2-Hard-Reset-your-phone"><a href="#2-Hard-Reset-your-phone" class="headerlink" title="2. Hard Reset your phone"></a>2. Hard Reset your phone</h3><p>To get around the Android lock screen, perform a factory reset. While resetting your phone allows you to set a new password, it also erases all data from your device. This method works like a charm, but it also requires more technical knowledge. To bypass screen lock via factory reset, follow these steps.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/face-unlock-android-2.jpg"                      alt="android hard reset"                ></p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Turn off your phone and hold the Power and Volume-down buttons simultaneously until the recovery mode screen appears. There are minor variations depending on the brand and model.</p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Select the Wipe data&#x2F;Factory Reset option using the volume buttons. To confirm the option, press the Power button.</p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Choose Yes &gt; Delete All User Data, then press the power button to continue. When the process is complete, turn on your phone.</p><p>So, before facing such awkward cases, like data loss, we suggest you have a backup habit of keeping your data safe.</p><h3 id="3-Google-Find-My-Device"><a href="#3-Google-Find-My-Device" class="headerlink" title="3. Google Find My Device"></a>3. Google Find My Device</h3><p>Google Find My Device is a service that lets you remotely lock, track, and wipe data from stolen or lost phones. With a Google account and the password, it won’t be complicated to remove any locks on your phone. You can bypass the Android lock screen by following the steps below:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/face-unlock-android-3.jpg"                      alt="google find my device data reset"                ></p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Navigate to Find My Device and sign in with your Google account.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Your phone receives a notification.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Select Erase Device, confirm, and click Erase as a warning pops up on the screen.</p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> The factory reset process on your phone begins. When it’s finished, choose My Google Account instead of using your phone as if it were brand new.</p><p>Just like the hard reset, after using Google Find My Device, all your data and settings will be erased. Please make everything well prepared before you decide to unlock your device.</p><h2 id="Easiest-Way-to-Unlock-Your-Android-Face-Recognition-Using-Dr-Fone-Screen-unlock"><a href="#Easiest-Way-to-Unlock-Your-Android-Face-Recognition-Using-Dr-Fone-Screen-unlock" class="headerlink" title="Easiest Way to Unlock Your Android Face Recognition Using Dr.Fone-Screen unlock"></a>Easiest Way to Unlock Your Android Face Recognition Using Dr.Fone-Screen unlock</h2><p>The methods mentioned above may be hard for you, and you don’t know any technical skills.

It can’t recognize your face. When you try multiple times in such cases, it will lock your device permanently. Are you stuck with a locked phone? And you’re still confused about what just happened. Face unlock may face problems such as</p><ul><li>Face unlock app may be buggy</li><li>Your face unlock settings may be unstable</li><li>Your phone camera or face unlock sensor may be damaged</li><li>Someone else may have registered their face without your permission</li></ul><p>Whatever the reason, they are equally big obstacles for you to use your phone as usual; trying to unlock your device can lead to a permanently locked phone. So how do you bypass face unlock?</p><p>Follow the guide below to bypass the face unlock settings and choose the best one for yourself.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/face-unlock-android-1.jpg"                      alt="face lock"                ></p><h2 id="How-To-Bypass-Android-Face-Lock-by-Ourselves"><a href="#How-To-Bypass-Android-Face-Lock-by-Ourselves" class="headerlink" title="How To Bypass Android Face Lock by Ourselves?"></a>How To Bypass Android Face Lock by Ourselves?</h2><p>If you want to bypass face lock by yourself, then different methods can help you. These are all tested and work well.</p><h3 id="1-A-Picture-Possibly-Bypasses-Face-Lock"><a href="#1-A-Picture-Possibly-Bypasses-Face-Lock" class="headerlink" title="1. A Picture Possibly Bypasses Face Lock"></a>1. A Picture Possibly Bypasses Face Lock</h3><p>You can use your photo to manipulate the face lock app. Simply use your photo to unlock the phone, which should work fine. If your phone doesn’t recognize your face from a photo, try again.</p><p>If it still doesn’t recognize your face, try a different photo or even change the camera’s lighting settings or the angles to see if that helps.</p><p>Anyway, this method is still unstable because of many uncontrollable factors. If everything fails, consider the following methods to bypass the face lock.</p><h3 id="2-Hard-Reset-your-phone"><a href="#2-Hard-Reset-your-phone" class="headerlink" title="2. Hard Reset your phone"></a>2. Hard Reset your phone</h3><p>To get around the Android lock screen, perform a factory reset. While resetting your phone allows you to set a new password, it also erases all data from your device. This method works like a charm, but it also requires more technical knowledge. To bypass screen lock via factory reset, follow these steps.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/face-unlock-android-2.jpg"                      alt="android hard reset"                ></p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Turn off your phone and hold the Power and Volume-down buttons simultaneously until the recovery mode screen appears. There are minor variations depending on the brand and model.</p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Select the Wipe data&#x2F;Factory Reset option using the volume buttons. To confirm the option, press the Power button.</p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Choose Yes &gt; Delete All User Data, then press the power button to continue. When the process is complete, turn on your phone.</p><p>So, before facing such awkward cases, like data loss, we suggest you have a backup habit of keeping your data safe.</p><h3 id="3-Google-Find-My-Device"><a href="#3-Google-Find-My-Device" class="headerlink" title="3. Google Find My Device"></a>3. Google Find My Device</h3><p>Google Find My Device is a service that lets you remotely lock, track, and wipe data from stolen or lost phones. With a Google account and the password, it won’t be complicated to remove any locks on your phone. You can bypass the Android lock screen by following the steps below:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/face-unlock-android-3.jpg"                      alt="google find my device data reset"                ></p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Navigate to Find My Device and sign in with your Google account.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Your phone receives a notification.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Select Erase Device, confirm, and click Erase as a warning pops up on the screen.</p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> The factory reset process on your phone begins. When it’s finished, choose My Google Account instead of using your phone as if it were brand new.</p><p>Just like the hard reset, after using Google Find My Device, all your data and settings will be erased. Please make everything well prepared before you decide to unlock your device.</p><h2 id="Easiest-Way-to-Unlock-Your-Android-Face-Recognition-Using-Dr-Fone-Screen-unlock"><a href="#Easiest-Way-to-Unlock-Your-Android-Face-Recognition-Using-Dr-Fone-Screen-unlock" class="headerlink" title="Easiest Way to Unlock Your Android Face Recognition Using Dr.Fone-Screen unlock"></a>Easiest Way to Unlock Your Android Face Recognition Using Dr.Fone-Screen unlock</h2><p>The methods mentioned above may be hard for you, and you don’t know any technical skills.

However, pattern locks are easy to crack, and today, we bring you all you want to know about pattern locks and how to create a <strong>hard pattern lock</strong>. Further to this, we also tell you how to move beyond pattern locks and what to do in case you forgot the hard pattern lock you just set and are unable to unlock your smartphone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/09/hard-pattern-lock-1.jpg"                      alt="creating more secure pattern locks"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-You-Need-to-Know-About-Pattern-Locks"><a href="#Part-1-What-You-Need-to-Know-About-Pattern-Locks" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What You Need to Know About Pattern Locks"></a>Part 1: What You Need to Know About Pattern Locks</h2><p>Pattern lock is an Android-only feature that makes it easy for users to have a modicum of security on their smartphones. Most users do not prefer using and remembering a PIN to unlock the smartphone. Creating a pattern makes it easier, somehow.</p><p>There is a 9-point grid on which you swipe your finger from point to point, in any direction, and when you take your finger off, that pattern you swiped becomes the key to unlock your smartphone.</p><p>Pattern locks were exceedingly common only a few years ago, and they are not recommended for use any longer due to concerns (mentioned later in the article).</p><h3 id="1-1-Popularity-and-Usage"><a href="#1-1-Popularity-and-Usage" class="headerlink" title="1.1: Popularity and Usage"></a>1.1: Popularity and Usage</h3><p>Old habits die hard, or so they say, right? That’s because it is true. We are creatures of habit, and pattern locks have been around for a long, long time. We are accustomed to pattern locks. So, even with even easier technologies such as fingerprint recognition and face recognition, we tend to gravitate towards the familiar old pattern lock.</p><p>The only thing is, there is a reason why pattern locks are no longer the preferred option to use for unlocking your smartphones. As it happens, that reason is security, and it can be very easy for humans to take a swipe (pardon the pun) at your pattern lock. And guess what? The research conducted suggests that they would get it right with an unsettling accuracy.</p><h3 id="1-2-Advantages-and-Drawbacks"><a href="#1-2-Advantages-and-Drawbacks" class="headerlink" title="1.2: Advantages and Drawbacks"></a>1.2: Advantages and Drawbacks</h3><p>With on-the-go lifestyles, our smartphones have become indispensable and contain some of the most sensitive aspects of our lives – IDs, credit and debit cards in digital wallets, photo and video memories, business documents – you name it, the smartphones have it, on the go. This has opened our lives up to the public at large, and if someone steals our smartphone or, best case, finds it, the only barrier preventing them from being privy to all that wealth of our sensitive information is that screen lock – the pattern lock that we set on our smartphones. That’s it – the single pattern lock stands between malicious actors and our data. You might be beginning to realize just how crazy this is.</p><h4 id="Advantages-of-Pattern-Locks"><a href="#Advantages-of-Pattern-Locks" class="headerlink" title="Advantages of Pattern Locks"></a>Advantages of Pattern Locks</h4><p>There are two advantages to using pattern locks. One, they are better than nothing. Two, they are easy to use. And that’s about it. There is no third advantage to pattern locks. We might think we set a hard pattern lock that nobody could guess, but, as research proves, we might be thinking too low of human prowess.</p><h4 id="Disadvantages-of-Pattern-Locks"><a href="#Disadvantages-of-Pattern-Locks" class="headerlink" title="Disadvantages of Pattern Locks"></a>Disadvantages of Pattern Locks</h4><p>Security, or rather, the lack of it, is the lone disadvantage of using a pattern lock. What good is a pattern lock that can be easily deciphered? Sure, they are easy to use, and they are better than not having anything, but would you really want to protect your life’s data with something that could be, as researchers found out, breached in under 5 attempts? We don’t think you do!</p><p>The research found that 64% of test subjects who were shown videos of people unlocking their phones could correctly guess a 6-point pattern lock, that too after viewing the video only once! That number shot up to 80% if they were allowed to see the video again. That is simply astounding and a nightmare for security. When it comes to PINs, only 11% could guess a 6-digit PIN after viewing the unlocking video once, and that number shot up to 27% when they could see the video two times.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-To-Create-a-Hard-Pattern-Lock-Including-Remembering-Complex-Patterns"><a href="#Part-2-How-To-Create-a-Hard-Pattern-Lock-Including-Remembering-Complex-Patterns" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How To Create a Hard Pattern Lock (Including Remembering Complex Patterns)"></a>Part 2: How To Create a Hard Pattern Lock (Including Remembering Complex Patterns)</h2><p>Now, if you must continue using a pattern lock, let’s help you know how to create a hard pattern lock that would not be as easy to decipher as easy pattern locks. For that, you should know how people use pattern locks, the kind of pattern locks they create, and the ones that are the most commonly used pattern locks. That way, you can avoid those fallacies and create a hard pattern lock for your smartphone.</p><h3 id="2-1-The-Pattern-Locks-People-Use-Most-Commonly"><a href="#2-1-The-Pattern-Locks-People-Use-Most-Commonly" class="headerlink" title="2.1: The Pattern Locks People Use Most Commonly"></a>2.1: The Pattern Locks People Use Most Commonly</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/09/hard-pattern-lock-2.jpg"                      alt="common pattern locks"                ></p><p>Marte Loge, an M.Sc. Computer Science student, gave a presentation on pattern locks at DEFCON 23 and made a bold claim. She said, “Tell me who you are, and I will tell you your lock pattern.”</p><p>She presented the following statistics to support her claim:</p><ul><li>- In her research, she found that 77% of people started with one of the 4 corners when creating a pattern lock.</li><li>- 44% of people started with the top-left dot and 15% with the top-right, while the bottom-left was preferred by 14% of her test subjects.</li><li>- People set 5-point pattern locks on average, and most users were content with a 4-point pattern.</li></ul><p>These are some of the most common pattern locks people create:</p><ul><li>- patterns in the shapes of alphabets,</li><li>- patterns in the shapes of numerals,</li><li>- patterns in any other simple shape, such as square, triangle, star, etc.</li></ul><p>To understand how this is a security nightmare, the possible combinations for a 4-point pattern are a measly 1624, whereas by adding just 1 more point to the pattern and creating a 5-point pattern, the number of possible combinations becomes 7152, an increase of 5528 combinations. In stark contrast, creating a 9-point pattern would give you over 140,000 possible combinations!</p><h3 id="2-2-How-to-Create-a-Hard-Pattern-Lock"><a href="#2-2-How-to-Create-a-Hard-Pattern-Lock" class="headerlink" title="2.2: How to Create a Hard Pattern Lock"></a>2.2: How to Create a Hard Pattern Lock</h3><p>Knowing what most people do when creating a pattern lock, it becomes easy to avoid those mistakes and instead create a hard pattern lock for oneself.</p><ul><li>- Do not start creating a pattern lock from any of the 4 corners of the grid.</li><li>- Never use your first initial as your pattern lock.</li><li>- Never use the shape of a numeral as your pattern lock.</li><li>- Use all 9 points on the grid to create your pattern lock, and contrary to popular belief, you can go over the connecting lines several times, creating a hard pattern lock that would not be as easy for people to decipher!</li></ul><h2 id="Part-3-Going-Beyond-Pattern-Locks"><a href="#Part-3-Going-Beyond-Pattern-Locks" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Going Beyond Pattern Locks"></a>Part 3: Going Beyond Pattern Locks</h2><p>You might think that now that you have set a hard pattern lock, you are good to go.

Using fingerprint recognition requires you to set a 6-digit PIN and then set a fingerprint to unlock your device. You can set additional fingerprints, too.</p><p>This way, your device is the most secure it can be today. In case your fingerprint is not recognized for any reason, the phone falls back on the 6-digit PIN that you can enter and unlock your phone.</p><p>While face recognition is available on both Android and Apple devices, it is truly secure only on Apple devices. This is why Apple iPhones released after the iPhone X in 2017 have come only with Face ID.

If you did indeed still set a hard pattern lock, only to promptly forget it, use Wondershare Dr.Fone – Screen Unlock (Android) to seamlessly unlock your phone right now.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins><br><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://android-unlock.techidaily.com/how-to-unlock-vivo-x90s-phone-without-password-by-drfone-android/"><u>How To Unlock Vivo X90S Phone Without Password?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-mastering-android-device-manager-the-ultimate-guide-to-unlocking-your-samsung-galaxy-m54-5g-device-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, Mastering Android Device Manager The Ultimate Guide to Unlocking Your Samsung Galaxy M54 5G Device</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-unlock-vivo-y17s-phone-password-without-factory-reset-full-guide-here-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, Unlock Vivo Y17s Phone Password Without Factory Reset Full Guide Here</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-top-10-password-cracking-tools-for-samsung-galaxy-a05-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, Top 10 Password Cracking Tools For Samsung Galaxy A05</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-change-vivo-s17e-lock-screen-clock-in-seconds-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, How To Change Vivo S17e Lock Screen Clock in Seconds</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-unlock.techidaily.com/how-to-change-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-5-lock-screen-password-by-drfone-android/"><u>How To Change Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5 Lock Screen Password?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-unlock.techidaily.com/top-apps-and-online-tools-to-track-vivo-y55s-5g-2023-phone-withwithout-imei-number-by-drfone-android/"><u>Top Apps and Online Tools To Track Vivo Y55s 5G (2023) Phone With/Without IMEI Number</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-unlock.techidaily.com/how-to-remove-forgotten-pin-of-your-vivo-s17t-by-drfone-android/"><u>How to Remove Forgotten PIN Of Your Vivo S17t</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-unlock-samsung-galaxy-m34-5g-bootloader-easily-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, How to Unlock Samsung Galaxy M34 5G Bootloader Easily</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-unlock.techidaily.com/lock-your-samsung-galaxy-m54-5g-phone-in-style-the-top-5-gesture-lock-screen-apps-by-drfone-android/"><u>Lock Your Samsung Galaxy M54 5G Phone in Style The Top 5 Gesture Lock Screen Apps</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-unlock.techidaily.com/top-10-password-cracking-tools-for-vivo-by-drfone-android/"><u>Top 10 Password Cracking Tools For Vivo</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-unlock.techidaily.com/mastering-android-device-manager-the-ultimate-guide-to-unlocking-your-oppo-reno-11-pro-5g-device-by-drfone-android/"><u>Mastering Android Device Manager The Ultimate Guide to Unlocking Your Oppo Reno 11 Pro 5G Device</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-unlock.techidaily.com/how-to-remove-or-bypass-knox-enrollment-service-on-samsung-galaxy-f54-5g-by-drfone-android/"><u>How To Remove or Bypass Knox Enrollment Service On Samsung Galaxy F54 5G</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-unlock-oppo-a79-5g-phone-without-google-account-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, How to Unlock Oppo A79 5G Phone without Google Account?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-unlock-samsung-galaxy-a54-5g-phone-password-without-factory-reset-full-guide-here-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, Unlock Samsung Galaxy A54 5G Phone Password Without Factory Reset Full Guide Here</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-unlock-samsung-galaxy-s24plus-phone-without-pin-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, How to Unlock Samsung Galaxy S24+ Phone without PIN</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-unlock.techidaily.com/forgot-pattern-lock-heres-how-you-can-unlock-samsung-galaxy-a14-5g-pattern-lock-screen-by-drfone-android/"><u>Forgot Pattern Lock?

It can’t recognize your face. When you try multiple times in such cases, it will lock your device permanently. Are you stuck with a locked phone? And you’re still confused about what just happened. Face unlock may face problems such as</p><ul><li>Face unlock app may be buggy</li><li>Your face unlock settings may be unstable</li><li>Your phone camera or face unlock sensor may be damaged</li><li>Someone else may have registered their face without your permission</li></ul><p>Whatever the reason, they are equally big obstacles for you to use your phone as usual; trying to unlock your device can lead to a permanently locked phone. So how do you bypass face unlock?</p><p>Follow the guide below to bypass the face unlock settings and choose the best one for yourself.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/face-unlock-android-1.jpg"                      alt="face lock"                ></p><h2 id="How-To-Bypass-Android-Face-Lock-by-Ourselves"><a href="#How-To-Bypass-Android-Face-Lock-by-Ourselves" class="headerlink" title="How To Bypass Android Face Lock by Ourselves?"></a>How To Bypass Android Face Lock by Ourselves?</h2><p>If you want to bypass face lock by yourself, then different methods can help you. These are all tested and work well.</p><h3 id="1-A-Picture-Possibly-Bypasses-Face-Lock"><a href="#1-A-Picture-Possibly-Bypasses-Face-Lock" class="headerlink" title="1. A Picture Possibly Bypasses Face Lock"></a>1. A Picture Possibly Bypasses Face Lock</h3><p>You can use your photo to manipulate the face lock app. Simply use your photo to unlock the phone, which should work fine. If your phone doesn’t recognize your face from a photo, try again.</p><p>If it still doesn’t recognize your face, try a different photo or even change the camera’s lighting settings or the angles to see if that helps.</p><p>Anyway, this method is still unstable because of many uncontrollable factors. If everything fails, consider the following methods to bypass the face lock.</p><h3 id="2-Hard-Reset-your-phone"><a href="#2-Hard-Reset-your-phone" class="headerlink" title="2. Hard Reset your phone"></a>2. Hard Reset your phone</h3><p>To get around the Android lock screen, perform a factory reset. While resetting your phone allows you to set a new password, it also erases all data from your device. This method works like a charm, but it also requires more technical knowledge. To bypass screen lock via factory reset, follow these steps.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/face-unlock-android-2.jpg"                      alt="android hard reset"                ></p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Turn off your phone and hold the Power and Volume-down buttons simultaneously until the recovery mode screen appears. There are minor variations depending on the brand and model.</p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Select the Wipe data&#x2F;Factory Reset option using the volume buttons. To confirm the option, press the Power button.</p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Choose Yes &gt; Delete All User Data, then press the power button to continue. When the process is complete, turn on your phone.</p><p>So, before facing such awkward cases, like data loss, we suggest you have a backup habit of keeping your data safe.</p><h3 id="3-Google-Find-My-Device"><a href="#3-Google-Find-My-Device" class="headerlink" title="3. Google Find My Device"></a>3. Google Find My Device</h3><p>Google Find My Device is a service that lets you remotely lock, track, and wipe data from stolen or lost phones. With a Google account and the password, it won’t be complicated to remove any locks on your phone. You can bypass the Android lock screen by following the steps below:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/face-unlock-android-3.jpg"                      alt="google find my device data reset"                ></p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Navigate to Find My Device and sign in with your Google account.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Your phone receives a notification.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Select Erase Device, confirm, and click Erase as a warning pops up on the screen.</p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> The factory reset process on your phone begins. When it’s finished, choose My Google Account instead of using your phone as if it were brand new.</p><p>Just like the hard reset, after using Google Find My Device, all your data and settings will be erased. Please make everything well prepared before you decide to unlock your device.</p><h2 id="Easiest-Way-to-Unlock-Your-Android-Face-Recognition-Using-Dr-Fone-Screen-unlock"><a href="#Easiest-Way-to-Unlock-Your-Android-Face-Recognition-Using-Dr-Fone-Screen-unlock" class="headerlink" title="Easiest Way to Unlock Your Android Face Recognition Using Dr.Fone-Screen unlock"></a>Easiest Way to Unlock Your Android Face Recognition Using Dr.Fone-Screen unlock</h2><p>The methods mentioned above may be hard for you, and you don’t know any technical skills.

It can’t recognize your face. When you try multiple times in such cases, it will lock your device permanently. Are you stuck with a locked phone? And you’re still confused about what just happened. Face unlock may face problems such as</p><ul><li>Face unlock app may be buggy</li><li>Your face unlock settings may be unstable</li><li>Your phone camera or face unlock sensor may be damaged</li><li>Someone else may have registered their face without your permission</li></ul><p>Whatever the reason, they are equally big obstacles for you to use your phone as usual; trying to unlock your device can lead to a permanently locked phone. So how do you bypass face unlock?</p><p>Follow the guide below to bypass the face unlock settings and choose the best one for yourself.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/face-unlock-android-1.jpg"                      alt="face lock"                ></p><h2 id="How-To-Bypass-Android-Face-Lock-by-Ourselves"><a href="#How-To-Bypass-Android-Face-Lock-by-Ourselves" class="headerlink" title="How To Bypass Android Face Lock by Ourselves?"></a>How To Bypass Android Face Lock by Ourselves?</h2><p>If you want to bypass face lock by yourself, then different methods can help you. These are all tested and work well.</p><h3 id="1-A-Picture-Possibly-Bypasses-Face-Lock"><a href="#1-A-Picture-Possibly-Bypasses-Face-Lock" class="headerlink" title="1. A Picture Possibly Bypasses Face Lock"></a>1. A Picture Possibly Bypasses Face Lock</h3><p>You can use your photo to manipulate the face lock app. Simply use your photo to unlock the phone, which should work fine. If your phone doesn’t recognize your face from a photo, try again.</p><p>If it still doesn’t recognize your face, try a different photo or even change the camera’s lighting settings or the angles to see if that helps.</p><p>Anyway, this method is still unstable because of many uncontrollable factors. If everything fails, consider the following methods to bypass the face lock.</p><h3 id="2-Hard-Reset-your-phone"><a href="#2-Hard-Reset-your-phone" class="headerlink" title="2. Hard Reset your phone"></a>2. Hard Reset your phone</h3><p>To get around the Android lock screen, perform a factory reset. While resetting your phone allows you to set a new password, it also erases all data from your device. This method works like a charm, but it also requires more technical knowledge. To bypass screen lock via factory reset, follow these steps.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/face-unlock-android-2.jpg"                      alt="android hard reset"                ></p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Turn off your phone and hold the Power and Volume-down buttons simultaneously until the recovery mode screen appears. There are minor variations depending on the brand and model.</p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Select the Wipe data&#x2F;Factory Reset option using the volume buttons. To confirm the option, press the Power button.</p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Choose Yes &gt; Delete All User Data, then press the power button to continue. When the process is complete, turn on your phone.</p><p>So, before facing such awkward cases, like data loss, we suggest you have a backup habit of keeping your data safe.</p><h3 id="3-Google-Find-My-Device"><a href="#3-Google-Find-My-Device" class="headerlink" title="3. Google Find My Device"></a>3. Google Find My Device</h3><p>Google Find My Device is a service that lets you remotely lock, track, and wipe data from stolen or lost phones. With a Google account and the password, it won’t be complicated to remove any locks on your phone. You can bypass the Android lock screen by following the steps below:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/face-unlock-android-3.jpg"                      alt="google find my device data reset"                ></p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Navigate to Find My Device and sign in with your Google account.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Your phone receives a notification.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Select Erase Device, confirm, and click Erase as a warning pops up on the screen.</p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> The factory reset process on your phone begins. When it’s finished, choose My Google Account instead of using your phone as if it were brand new.</p><p>Just like the hard reset, after using Google Find My Device, all your data and settings will be erased. Please make everything well prepared before you decide to unlock your device.</p><h2 id="Easiest-Way-to-Unlock-Your-Android-Face-Recognition-Using-Dr-Fone-Screen-unlock"><a href="#Easiest-Way-to-Unlock-Your-Android-Face-Recognition-Using-Dr-Fone-Screen-unlock" class="headerlink" title="Easiest Way to Unlock Your Android Face Recognition Using Dr.Fone-Screen unlock"></a>Easiest Way to Unlock Your Android Face Recognition Using Dr.Fone-Screen unlock</h2><p>The methods mentioned above may be hard for you, and you don’t know any technical skills.

It can’t recognize your face. When you try multiple times in such cases, it will lock your device permanently. Are you stuck with a locked phone? And you’re still confused about what just happened. Face unlock may face problems such as</p><ul><li>Face unlock app may be buggy</li><li>Your face unlock settings may be unstable</li><li>Your phone camera or face unlock sensor may be damaged</li><li>Someone else may have registered their face without your permission</li></ul><p>Whatever the reason, they are equally big obstacles for you to use your phone as usual; trying to unlock your device can lead to a permanently locked phone. So how do you bypass face unlock?</p><p>Follow the guide below to bypass the face unlock settings and choose the best one for yourself.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/face-unlock-android-1.jpg"                      alt="face lock"                ></p><h2 id="How-To-Bypass-Android-Face-Lock-by-Ourselves"><a href="#How-To-Bypass-Android-Face-Lock-by-Ourselves" class="headerlink" title="How To Bypass Android Face Lock by Ourselves?"></a>How To Bypass Android Face Lock by Ourselves?</h2><p>If you want to bypass face lock by yourself, then different methods can help you. These are all tested and work well.</p><h3 id="1-A-Picture-Possibly-Bypasses-Face-Lock"><a href="#1-A-Picture-Possibly-Bypasses-Face-Lock" class="headerlink" title="1. A Picture Possibly Bypasses Face Lock"></a>1. A Picture Possibly Bypasses Face Lock</h3><p>You can use your photo to manipulate the face lock app. Simply use your photo to unlock the phone, which should work fine. If your phone doesn’t recognize your face from a photo, try again.</p><p>If it still doesn’t recognize your face, try a different photo or even change the camera’s lighting settings or the angles to see if that helps.</p><p>Anyway, this method is still unstable because of many uncontrollable factors. If everything fails, consider the following methods to bypass the face lock.</p><h3 id="2-Hard-Reset-your-phone"><a href="#2-Hard-Reset-your-phone" class="headerlink" title="2. Hard Reset your phone"></a>2. Hard Reset your phone</h3><p>To get around the Android lock screen, perform a factory reset. While resetting your phone allows you to set a new password, it also erases all data from your device. This method works like a charm, but it also requires more technical knowledge. To bypass screen lock via factory reset, follow these steps.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/face-unlock-android-2.jpg"                      alt="android hard reset"                ></p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Turn off your phone and hold the Power and Volume-down buttons simultaneously until the recovery mode screen appears. There are minor variations depending on the brand and model.</p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Select the Wipe data&#x2F;Factory Reset option using the volume buttons. To confirm the option, press the Power button.</p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Choose Yes &gt; Delete All User Data, then press the power button to continue. When the process is complete, turn on your phone.</p><p>So, before facing such awkward cases, like data loss, we suggest you have a backup habit of keeping your data safe.</p><h3 id="3-Google-Find-My-Device"><a href="#3-Google-Find-My-Device" class="headerlink" title="3. Google Find My Device"></a>3. Google Find My Device</h3><p>Google Find My Device is a service that lets you remotely lock, track, and wipe data from stolen or lost phones. With a Google account and the password, it won’t be complicated to remove any locks on your phone. You can bypass the Android lock screen by following the steps below:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/face-unlock-android-3.jpg"                      alt="google find my device data reset"                ></p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Navigate to Find My Device and sign in with your Google account.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Your phone receives a notification.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Select Erase Device, confirm, and click Erase as a warning pops up on the screen.</p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> The factory reset process on your phone begins. When it’s finished, choose My Google Account instead of using your phone as if it were brand new.</p><p>Just like the hard reset, after using Google Find My Device, all your data and settings will be erased. Please make everything well prepared before you decide to unlock your device.</p><h2 id="Easiest-Way-to-Unlock-Your-Android-Face-Recognition-Using-Dr-Fone-Screen-unlock"><a href="#Easiest-Way-to-Unlock-Your-Android-Face-Recognition-Using-Dr-Fone-Screen-unlock" class="headerlink" title="Easiest Way to Unlock Your Android Face Recognition Using Dr.Fone-Screen unlock"></a>Easiest Way to Unlock Your Android Face Recognition Using Dr.Fone-Screen unlock</h2><p>The methods mentioned above may be hard for you, and you don’t know any technical skills.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Full-Tutorial-to-Bypass-Your-Asus-ROG-Phone-8-Face-Lock"><a href="#Full-Tutorial-to-Bypass-Your-Asus-ROG-Phone-8-Face-Lock" class="headerlink" title="Full Tutorial to Bypass Your Asus ROG Phone 8 Face Lock?"></a>Full Tutorial to Bypass Your Asus ROG Phone 8 Face Lock?</h2><p>Your android phone face unlock may be buggy, or the camera may be damaged. It can’t recognize your face. When you try multiple times in such cases, it will lock your device permanently. Are you stuck with a locked phone? And you’re still confused about what just happened. Face unlock may face problems such as</p><ul><li>Face unlock app may be buggy</li><li>Your face unlock settings may be unstable</li><li>Your phone camera or face unlock sensor may be damaged</li><li>Someone else may have registered their face without your permission</li></ul><p>Whatever the reason, they are equally big obstacles for you to use your phone as usual; trying to unlock your device can lead to a permanently locked phone. So how do you bypass face unlock?</p><p>Follow the guide below to bypass the face unlock settings and choose the best one for yourself.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/face-unlock-android-1.jpg"                      alt="face lock"                ></p><h2 id="How-To-Bypass-Android-Face-Lock-by-Ourselves"><a href="#How-To-Bypass-Android-Face-Lock-by-Ourselves" class="headerlink" title="How To Bypass Android Face Lock by Ourselves?"></a>How To Bypass Android Face Lock by Ourselves?</h2><p>If you want to bypass face lock by yourself, then different methods can help you. These are all tested and work well.</p><h3 id="1-A-Picture-Possibly-Bypasses-Face-Lock"><a href="#1-A-Picture-Possibly-Bypasses-Face-Lock" class="headerlink" title="1. A Picture Possibly Bypasses Face Lock"></a>1. A Picture Possibly Bypasses Face Lock</h3><p>You can use your photo to manipulate the face lock app. Simply use your photo to unlock the phone, which should work fine. If your phone doesn’t recognize your face from a photo, try again.</p><p>If it still doesn’t recognize your face, try a different photo or even change the camera’s lighting settings or the angles to see if that helps.</p><p>Anyway, this method is still unstable because of many uncontrollable factors. If everything fails, consider the following methods to bypass the face lock.</p><h3 id="2-Hard-Reset-your-phone"><a href="#2-Hard-Reset-your-phone" class="headerlink" title="2. Hard Reset your phone"></a>2. Hard Reset your phone</h3><p>To get around the Android lock screen, perform a factory reset. While resetting your phone allows you to set a new password, it also erases all data from your device. This method works like a charm, but it also requires more technical knowledge. To bypass screen lock via factory reset, follow these steps.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/face-unlock-android-2.jpg"                      alt="android hard reset"                ></p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Turn off your phone and hold the Power and Volume-down buttons simultaneously until the recovery mode screen appears. There are minor variations depending on the brand and model.</p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Select the Wipe data&#x2F;Factory Reset option using the volume buttons. To confirm the option, press the Power button.</p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Choose Yes &gt; Delete All User Data, then press the power button to continue. When the process is complete, turn on your phone.</p><p>So, before facing such awkward cases, like data loss, we suggest you have a backup habit of keeping your data safe.</p><h3 id="3-Google-Find-My-Device"><a href="#3-Google-Find-My-Device" class="headerlink" title="3. Google Find My Device"></a>3. Google Find My Device</h3><p>Google Find My Device is a service that lets you remotely lock, track, and wipe data from stolen or lost phones. With a Google account and the password, it won’t be complicated to remove any locks on your phone. You can bypass the Android lock screen by following the steps below:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/face-unlock-android-3.jpg"                      alt="google find my device data reset"                ></p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Navigate to Find My Device and sign in with your Google account.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Your phone receives a notification.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Select Erase Device, confirm, and click Erase as a warning pops up on the screen.</p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> The factory reset process on your phone begins.

In Android, this is called rooting. In simple terms, it means having the root permission to your phone. Some Android apps will require you the root permission, e.g., flashing your ROM. In this part, we will explain how you can show the Wi-Fi password on your Android with root.</p><p>To find the Wi-Fi passwords on your Android phone, you need to have an app to explore files which also supports a root user. In this case, ES FileExplorer or Root Explorer will come in handy. However, it turns out that the latter is offered at $3. Let’s use the free ES File Explorer.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14556285763404.jpg"                      alt="android show wifi password"                ></p><h3 id="Steps-of-getting-Wi-Fi-password-on-Android-with-root"><a href="#Steps-of-getting-Wi-Fi-password-on-Android-with-root" class="headerlink" title="Steps of getting Wi-Fi password on Android with root"></a>Steps of getting Wi-Fi password on Android with root</h3><p>In only four steps, we, at this moment, learn how we can find the password of a Wi-Fi on an Android phone.</p><p>Step 1: Install the ES File Explorer</p><p>Download the ES File Explorer from your play store, install it, and open it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14556286507084.jpg"                      alt="android show wifi password"                ></p><p>Step 2: Enable Root Explorer</p><p>The root explorer needs to be enabled so that you can reach the root folders of the Wi-Fi passwords you need. By default, the root feature in this ES explorer is not enabled. To enable it, just tap on the list menu on the top left corner.:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14556292611536.jpg"                      alt="android show wifi password"                ></p><p>This will drop down a list of controls.

The short answer is yes. However, this is a bit involving but simple. You don’t need to be a computer guru to do it, but you need to have a computer and some internet access of course. The key thing is to find a way through which we can fetch the password file from the phone without using a root access protocol in the Android.

Google Find My Device"></a>1. Google Find My Device</h3><p>Google Find My Device is an inbuilt feature in Sony phones to unlock your phone through Google accounts. You can utilize it to unlock the Sony screen lock. However, you need to know that you will lose all your files on the Sony phone after the <strong>Sony Xperia 5 V password unlocks</strong>. Therefore, make sure to back up your data before proceeding with the following steps:</p><ul><li>Ensure your locked Sony phone is connected to your Google account and WiFi&#x2F;Data. Then open the Find My Device site on a PC, and sign in with your phone’s Google account.</li><li>Kindly select your device, and tap the “Erase Device” option.</li><li>Type your Google account credentials once more. Then, click the “Erase” symbol to begin the unlocking system.

Answer Security Questions"></a>2. Answer Security Questions</h3><p>This method is for you if you have set security questions while making your Google ID. By addressing those questions, you can unlock the Sony Xperia 5 V screen lock. In any case, this way is invalid on some old Android phones.</p><p>To unlock this way, you need to press the Forgot Password option. If you can’t see the “Forgot Pattern&#x2F;Password button on your phone, follow these steps:</p><ul><li>Try unlocking your Sony smartphone with some wrong patterns a few times. Then you will see the “Forgot Pattern” symbol on the screen and tap it.</li><li>Select the “Answer question” option to get to your security questions. Then, at that point, answer each of them correctly.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/09/oppo-a3s-password-unlock-2.jpg"                      alt="answer question"                ></p><ul><li>It will automatically unlock your device if you answer all questions accurately. Then, it will expect you to set another screen lock for your OPPO. Therefore, keep the new PIN to yourself.</li></ul><h3 id="3-Hard-Reset"><a href="#3-Hard-Reset" class="headerlink" title="3. Hard Reset"></a>3. Hard Reset</h3><p>If you wouldn’t worry about losing your user data, you can attempt this unlock method for your Sony Xperia 5 V. You won’t require any account or applications. It requires you to have sufficient battery life. It is simple. So let’s see how it is done.</p><ul><li>Check whether the battery percentage is over half. Then power off your Sony phone by holding the “Side&#x2F;Power” key for around 10 seconds.</li><li>Press and hold the “Volume Down” and “Side&#x2F;Power” buttons till the Sony logo appears on display. Then, at that point, your phone is in recovery mode.</li><li>Utilize the volume keys to pick the “Wipe Data&#x2F;Factory Reset” choice, and press the “Side&#x2F;Power” button to select it.

Therefore, make sure to back up your data before proceeding with the following steps:</p><ul><li>Ensure your locked Motorola phone is connected to your Google account and WiFi&#x2F;Data.

You won’t require any account or applications. It requires you to have sufficient battery life. It is simple. So let’s see how it is done.</p><ul><li>Check whether the battery percentage is over half. Then power off your Motorola phone by holding the “Side&#x2F;Power” key for around 10 seconds.</li><li>Press and hold the “Volume Down” and “Side&#x2F;Power” buttons till the Motorola logo appears on display. Then, at that point, your phone is in recovery mode.</li><li>Utilize the volume keys to pick the “Wipe Data&#x2F;Factory Reset” choice, and press the “Side&#x2F;Power” button to select it. Then, at that point, pick “Yes” to go on.

Once you are there, you can easily send a notification to the phone you want to enable remote password application and wiping upon.</p><p>ADM comes with a set of features that helps you to unlock your Android phone as well. It not only helps you to find your device, but also Ring it, lock it, and wipe and erase all the data as well, if your phone is lost or stolen. Once you’re logged into the ADM website from your computer, you can avail all these options once your phone is located. It is a wise option to get your device locked by Android Device Manager in case it is lost or stolen, so that your phone is secured.</p><p>Android Device Manager can unlock your phone under a specific set of circumstances only.</p><ul><li>• First of all, Android Device Manager needs to be enabled on your phone before it is lost, stolen, etc.</li><li>• Secondly, your phone can only be tracked by ADM if the GPS option is switched on.</li><li>• Thirdly, the Motorola Moto G23 device you are using for ADM, must be connected to Wi-Fi or internet, to login to your Google account.</li><li>• Lastly, Android Device Manager is not compatible for all Android versions. For now, it is only compatible with devices running Android 4.4 and above, so your phone must be in this category for ADM to work.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-unlock-Android-phone-with-Android-Device-Manager"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-unlock-Android-phone-with-Android-Device-Manager" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to unlock Android phone with Android Device Manager?"></a>Part 2: How to unlock Android phone with Android Device Manager?</h2><p>Just act according to the following steps, and the Android Device Manager will unlock your phone.</p><p>1.

Then, sign in with the help of your Google login details that you had used in your locked phone as well.</p><p>3. In the ADM interface, choose the Motorola Moto G23 device you want to unlock. Now, select “Lock”.</p><p>4. Enter a temporary password. Now go ahead and click on “Lock” again.</p><p>5. If the previous step was successful, you should be seeing a confirmation below the box with the buttons – Ring, Lock and Erase.</p><p>6. Now, you should see a password field on your phone screen.

Many users have reported the issue, that when they have tried using ADM to unlock their locked device, an error message has occurred, saying, “since Google has verified that a screen lock is already set”. Basically, this error message conveys that you will not be able to unlock your phone using Android Device Manager, and this is a flaw on Google’s part, not your phone’s.</p><h2 id="Part-3-What-to-do-if-phone-is-locked-by-Android-Device-Manager"><a href="#Part-3-What-to-do-if-phone-is-locked-by-Android-Device-Manager" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: What to do if phone is locked by Android Device Manager"></a>Part 3: What to do if phone is locked by Android Device Manager</h2><p>There are 2 situations where you would want to know how to unlock the Android Device Manager lock – one, when you have unfortunately forgotten the screen lock passcode and the other is when your phone is locked by Android Device Manager.</p><p>ADM is built to completely lock your device so that unknown people cannot access it. So, if your phone is locked by Android Device Manager, you might be in a problem.While ADM is a wonderful tool to lock your phone or erase and wipe data if its stolen or lost, most of the users have reported the issue that they cannot unlock their phones that are locked by Android Device Manager. A possible solution to this is adding a temporary password via Google login and bypassing the ADM lock. Or, you can try resetting the password again by entering a new password via ADM. If that does not work, you can make use of several third-party applications which can be found in the internet, that will help to completely erase the Android Device Manager lock.</p><p>So, now you know how to unlock the Android Device Manager lock.

However, it wouldn’t take the <strong>Motorola Moto G Stylus (2023) pattern unlock</strong> when I tried opening the phone. Maybe the kid has accidentally changed the lock, but I don’t know what to do. Please help me.</em></p><p>This article is for you if you have been locked out of your Motorola phone. Many individuals fail to remember their password or change it accidentally. However, it is not a big deal now. We’ll talk about the best <strong>Motorola Moto G Stylus (2023) password unlock tool</strong> today.</p><p>There are multiple ways to unlock your locked Motorola device.

Google Find My Device"></a>1. Google Find My Device</h3><p>Google Find My Device is an inbuilt feature in Motorola phones to unlock your phone through Google accounts. You can utilize it to unlock the Motorola screen lock. However, you need to know that you will lose all your files on the Motorola phone after the <strong>Motorola Moto G Stylus (2023) password unlocks</strong>. Therefore, make sure to back up your data before proceeding with the following steps:</p><ul><li>Ensure your locked Motorola phone is connected to your Google account and WiFi&#x2F;Data. Then open the Find My Device site on a PC, and sign in with your phone’s Google account.</li><li>Kindly select your device, and tap the “Erase Device” option.</li><li>Type your Google account credentials once more. Then, click the “Erase” symbol to begin the unlocking system. That will remove the pattern lock from your OPPO, and you can open it without effort.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/09/oppo-a3s-password-unlock-1.jpg"                      alt="google find my device"                ></p><h3 id="2-Answer-Security-Questions"><a href="#2-Answer-Security-Questions" class="headerlink" title="2. Answer Security Questions"></a>2. Answer Security Questions</h3><p>This method is for you if you have set security questions while making your Google ID. By addressing those questions, you can unlock the Motorola Moto G Stylus (2023) screen lock. In any case, this way is invalid on some old Android phones.</p><p>To unlock this way, you need to press the Forgot Password option. If you can’t see the “Forgot Pattern&#x2F;Password button on your phone, follow these steps:</p><ul><li>Try unlocking your Motorola smartphone with some wrong patterns a few times. Then you will see the “Forgot Pattern” symbol on the screen and tap it.</li><li>Select the “Answer question” option to get to your security questions. Then, at that point, answer each of them correctly.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/09/oppo-a3s-password-unlock-2.jpg"                      alt="answer question"                ></p><ul><li>It will automatically unlock your device if you answer all questions accurately. Then, it will expect you to set another screen lock for your OPPO. Therefore, keep the new PIN to yourself.</li></ul><h3 id="3-Hard-Reset"><a href="#3-Hard-Reset" class="headerlink" title="3. Hard Reset"></a>3. Hard Reset</h3><p>If you wouldn’t worry about losing your user data, you can attempt this unlock method for your Motorola Moto G Stylus (2023). You won’t require any account or applications. It requires you to have sufficient battery life. It is simple. So let’s see how it is done.</p><ul><li>Check whether the battery percentage is over half. Then power off your Motorola phone by holding the “Side&#x2F;Power” key for around 10 seconds.</li><li>Press and hold the “Volume Down” and “Side&#x2F;Power” buttons till the Motorola logo appears on display. Then, at that point, your phone is in recovery mode.</li><li>Utilize the volume keys to pick the “Wipe Data&#x2F;Factory Reset” choice, and press the “Side&#x2F;Power” button to select it. Then, at that point, pick “Yes” to go on. You can reboot your Motorola after the reset is finished, and the lock will be no more.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/09/oppo-a3s-password-unlock-3.jpg"                      alt="wipe data"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-The-Efficient-Tool-for-Your-Motorola-Moto-G-Stylus-2023-Unlock"><a href="#Part-2-The-Efficient-Tool-for-Your-Motorola-Moto-G-Stylus-2023-Unlock" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: The Efficient Tool for Your Motorola Moto G Stylus (2023) Unlock"></a>Part 2: The Efficient Tool for Your Motorola Moto G Stylus (2023) Unlock</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare-dr-fone-unlock-android-screen/" >Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (Android) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> offers a wonderful tool that works to unlock Motorola devices rapidly.

Repeat this process 10 to 11 times until you can no longer highlight the series.</li><li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Go back to the lock screen. Open the <strong>Camera</strong> app by tapping the camera icon or sliding left. Simultaneously, pull down the Notification Panel from the top.</li><li><strong>Step 5:</strong> In the Notification Panel, tap the gear icon to try and access your device’s settings.</li><li><strong>Step 6:</strong> When prompted for a password, long-press and paste the copied string into the password field.
