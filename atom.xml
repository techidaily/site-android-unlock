To learn how to set up a lock screen pattern on an Android device, simply follow these steps:</p><ul><li>1. Firstly, unlock your device and go to its Settings. You can access it from the Home Screen or from its Notification Center.</li><li>2. Under the personal or privacy section, you can access the “Lock Screen and Security” option.</li><li>3. In some versions, the option is also listed right at the top of the settings (in its quick access).</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/09/15057378431872.jpg"                      alt="setup android pattern lock screen-unlock your device"                > <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/09/15057378838236.jpg"                      alt="setup android pattern lock screen-Under the personal or privacy section"                > <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/09/15057379016188.jpg"                      alt="setup android pattern lock screen-access Lock Screen and Security"                ></p><ul><li>4. To set up a pattern lock screen, tap on the “Screen lock type” feature.</li><li>5. This will provide a list of all the different kinds of locks that you can apply. Ideally, it would be password, pin, pattern, swipe, or none. In “Swipe”, you can unlock a device just by swiping the screen. Whereas, in pattern, pin, or password, you would be needed to provide the respective pattern&#x2F;pin&#x2F;password to unlock the Lava Blaze Curve 5G device.</li><li>6. We recommend setting up a lock screen pattern instead. To do this, tap on the “Pattern” option.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/09/15057379466607.jpg"                      alt="setup android pattern lock screen-tap on the “Screen lock type” feature"                > <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/15057379692063.jpg"                      alt="setup android pattern lock screen- provide the respective pattern"                > <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/09/15057379835226.jpg"                      alt="setup android pattern lock screen-tap on the “Pattern” option"                ></p><ul><li>7. From the next screen, you can simply draw any kind of pattern of your choice. Ideally, it should join at least 4 dots on the screen. We recommend using a strong screen lock pattern to provide unmatched security to your device.</li><li>8. Furthermore, you need to confirm your choice and provide the same pattern once again. Make sure that you draw the same pattern here.</li><li>9. Additionally, the interface will ask you to provide a security pin as well. In case if you will forget your pattern, then you can access your phone by taking the assistance of this pin.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/09/15057380143598.jpg"                      alt="setup android pattern lock screen"                > <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/09/15057380317550.jpg"                      alt="setup android pattern lock screen-provide the same pattern"                > <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/09/15057380506350.jpg"                      alt="setup android pattern lock screen-provide a security pin"                ></p><ul><li>10. Similarly, you would be required to confirm the pin as well to finish the setup.</li><li>11. That’s it! By completing these steps, a screen lock pattern will be implemented on your device.</li></ul><p>Later, you can follow the same drill to change your device’s lock screen pattern as well. Though, you would be needed to provide the existing pattern to access these features. Out of all the lock screen options, you should go with the pattern lock. Not only it is the most accessible option, it also provides fast results with an added security.</p><h2 id="Part-2-What-to-do-if-you-forget-Android-pattern-lock"><a href="#Part-2-What-to-do-if-you-forget-Android-pattern-lock" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: What to do if you forget Android pattern lock?"></a>Part 2: What to do if you forget Android pattern lock?</h2><p>After following the above-mentioned tutorial, you would be able to set up a pattern lock screen on your device.

It allows you to unlock your phone bootloader. A bootloader or bootstrap loader gathers the operating system files, loads them into memory, and hands over control, essentially starting your device. Unlocking the bootloader assists you in installing custom ROMs, flashing custom kernels, and rooting your phone.</p><p>However, this freedom comes with some trade-offs. Most manufacturers will void your warranty if you unlock the bootloader, and it can also make your phone face higher risks of malware and other security threats. Additionally, it can be difficult to relock the bootloader once you unlock it.</p><p>If you encounter the <strong>OEM unlock missing</strong> on your Android phone despite wanting to unlock your bootloader, this article can help. You will learn the step-by-step guide for the different methods to fix the <strong>missing OEM unlock</strong> option. Before diving into solutions, let’s explore why this option might be unavailable in the first place.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/oem-unlock-missing-01.jpg"                      alt="using a phone at work"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-Why-Is-OEM-Unlock-Missing-on-Your-Device"><a href="#Part-1-Why-Is-OEM-Unlock-Missing-on-Your-Device" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Why Is OEM Unlock Missing on Your Device?"></a>Part 1: Why Is OEM Unlock Missing on Your Device?</h2><p>Finding that OEM Unlock is missing on your Android phones can be frustrating, particularly if you plan to modify your software or install a custom ROM. But don’t worry. There are several possible explanations for this. Let’s explore some of the most common reasons:</p><p>Manufacturer Restrictions</p><p>The <strong>Missing OEM Unlock</strong> option can often be due to restrictions imposed by your device’s manufacturers. They may intentionally remove this option to safeguard device security and compatibility. It is common with carrier-locked devices. As a result, the OEM Unlock option may not show.</p><p>Bootloader Already Unlocked</p><p>In some cases, the <strong>Android OEM Unlock Missing</strong> issue arises <a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/how-to-unlock-xiaomi-bootloader.html"><u>when the bootloader has already been unlocked</u></a>. Relocking the bootloader might make the option reappear. But exercise caution as this process can erase device data.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/oem-unlock-missing-02.jpg"                      alt="oem unlock option greyed out"                ></p><p>Developer Options Not Enabled</p><p>It might seem obvious, but sometimes the simplest things get overlooked. The OEM Unlock option can only be accessed from within Developer Options. If this menu isn’t enabled, you won’t see it.</p><p>Carrier-Locked Devices</p><p>The <strong>OEM Unlock Missing</strong> issue can also occur if your device is <a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/sim-unlock/carrier-unlock-android-phone.html"><u>carrier-locked</u></a>. Carriers often impose restrictions to prevent users from switching networks, and bootloader unlocking is one way to do that. Unfortunately, the <strong>missing OEM Unlock</strong> option is usually intentional, and unlocking your device can be more complicated.</p><p>Security Features</p><p>Enhanced security features, like Samsung’s KNOX, can sometimes conceal the OEM Unlock option. Temporarily turning off these features might show the option, but it’s crucial to be aware of the potential security implications of doing so.</p><p>Corrupted Bootloader</p><p>A corrupted bootloader can also lead to the <strong>Android OEM Unlock missing</strong> problem. The bootloader plays a role in the boot process, and if it’s damaged, it might not display the necessary options. This can be caused by software glitches, failed flashing attempts, or even <a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/device-diagnostics/how-to-run-a-hardware-test-on-xiaomi.html"><u>hardware issues</u></a>. In this scenario, you might need to consult your device’s manufacturer or a technical specialist to help repair or re-flash the bootloader.</p><p>Connectivity Issues</p><p>A poor connection between your device and computer can also prevent the OEM Unlocking from showing up. Check your cables and try using different USB ports to ensure a stable connection.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-To-Enable-Missing-OEM-Unlock-Without-a-Password"><a href="#Part-2-How-To-Enable-Missing-OEM-Unlock-Without-a-Password" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How To Enable Missing OEM Unlock Without a Password?"></a>Part 2: How To Enable Missing OEM Unlock Without a Password?</h2><p>Unlocking your phone’s bootloader (OEM Unlock) varies across models and brands. Some need a passcode or PIN after rebooting the phone, while others don’t. Even if your phone doesn’t require a separate password, your existing screen lock (password, PIN, pattern) will usually be needed to enable the <strong>missing OEM unlock</strong> option.</p><p>But what if you forgot that, too? <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/"><u>Wondershare Dr.Fone</u></a> - Screen Unlock can help bypass forgotten passwords and unlock your phone even if you don’t have the technical knowledge.

Remember, this process may erase your device data, so a complete backup is essential before proceeding.</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open the <strong>Settings</strong> app on your Android phone.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Navigate to <strong>About Phone</strong> at the bottom of the list, then tap <strong>Software information</strong>.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/oem-unlock-missing-08.jpg"                      alt="software information settings"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Tap on the <strong>Build number</strong> repeatedly (7 times) until you see a message saying, “<strong>You are now a developer!</strong>“ or similar.</li><li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Go back to <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>System</strong> and find the <strong>Developer options</strong> menu.</li><li><strong>Step 5:</strong> Scroll down and tap the toggle switch next to <strong>Enable OEM Unlock</strong> to turn it on.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/oem-unlock-missing-09.jpg"                      alt="enable oem unlock developer option"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 6:</strong> A warning message explaining the risks of turning on the OEM unlock will appear.

Android seems to be controlling a considerably high portion of our life. We have bought many gadgets that use this amazing OS and most of which are phones. But how much can you do with your Android phone? Developers are always making it more interesting to use this interface.</p><p>Most of the time, we use Android phones, we get faced with the need to access the internet. The Wi-Fi capability of these Android gadgets makes it super easy for us to surf the web. Throughout using Wi-Fi, we connect to a number of them. This could be at school, a sub-way café, the gym, buses, hospitals, hotels, towns, and the list is endless. A password secures most of this. Needless to say, our brain is weak to store all these passwords for future use, especially if you would want to connect with a different gadget you have recently bought or even your laptop. In this article, we will introduce you to how to find wifi password on rooted and also unrooted Android devices.</p><iframe allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/78mNMIr_wpI"></iframe><h2 id="Part-1-Show-Wifi-Password-on-Rooted-Android-Device"><a href="#Part-1-Show-Wifi-Password-on-Rooted-Android-Device" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Show Wifi Password on Rooted Android Device"></a>Part 1: Show Wifi Password on Rooted Android Device</h2><h3 id="What-is-Rooting"><a href="#What-is-Rooting" class="headerlink" title="What is Rooting?"></a>What is Rooting?</h3><p>First of all, what does rooting mean? You have probably used a Windows computer or even Linux. For the case of Windows, when installing a new program or software, it always prompts a dialog box saying, “Administrator permission required to run this program.” If you don’t have the administrator permission, you won’t install the program. In Android, this is called rooting. In simple terms, it means having the root permission to your phone. Some Android apps will require you the root permission, e.g., flashing your ROM. In this part, we will explain how you can show the Wi-Fi password on your Android with root.</p><p>To find the Wi-Fi passwords on your Android phone, you need to have an app to explore files which also supports a root user. In this case, ES FileExplorer or Root Explorer will come in handy. However, it turns out that the latter is offered at $3. Let’s use the free ES File Explorer.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14556285763404.jpg"                      alt="android show wifi password"                ></p><h3 id="Steps-of-getting-Wi-Fi-password-on-Android-with-root"><a href="#Steps-of-getting-Wi-Fi-password-on-Android-with-root" class="headerlink" title="Steps of getting Wi-Fi password on Android with root"></a>Steps of getting Wi-Fi password on Android with root</h3><p>In only four steps, we, at this moment, learn how we can find the password of a Wi-Fi on an Android phone.</p><p>Step 1: Install the ES File Explorer</p><p>Download the ES File Explorer from your play store, install it, and open it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14556286507084.jpg"                      alt="android show wifi password"                ></p><p>Step 2: Enable Root Explorer</p><p>The root explorer needs to be enabled so that you can reach the root folders of the Wi-Fi passwords you need. By default, the root feature in this ES explorer is not enabled. To enable it, just tap on the list menu on the top left corner.:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14556292611536.jpg"                      alt="android show wifi password"                ></p><p>This will drop down a list of controls.

You might mess up with important data and fail to access the Wi-Fi(s) in the future.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14556294042257.jpg"                      alt="android show wifi password"                ></p><p>As you can see above, we have found the Wi-Fi passwords on the android device. On each network profile, we have the name of the network represented by <em>name (ssid&#x3D;”{the name}”)</em>, the network’s password represented by <em>psk</em>, the network’s access point represented by <em>key_mgmt&#x3D;WPA-PSK</em> and its priority represented by <em>priority</em>.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Show-Wifi-Password-on-Android-without-Root"><a href="#Part-2-Show-Wifi-Password-on-Android-without-Root" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Show Wifi Password on Android without Root"></a>Part 2: Show Wifi Password on Android without Root</h2><p>What if I don’t have root access to my Android, can I still see Android Wi-Fi password? The short answer is yes. However, this is a bit involving but simple. You don’t need to be a computer guru to do it, but you need to have a computer and some internet access of course. The key thing is to find a way through which we can fetch the password file from the phone without using a root access protocol in the Android. This is made possible by some little programming insight using the Windows Command prompt.</p><h3 id="Steps-to-show-Wi-Fi-password-on-Android-without-root"><a href="#Steps-to-show-Wi-Fi-password-on-Android-without-root" class="headerlink" title="Steps to show Wi-Fi password on Android without root"></a>Steps to show Wi-Fi password on Android without root</h3><p>Step 1: Access the Developer authority</p><p>To access the files that Android uses to run passwords, you must first become a developer.

Disabling Google Smart Lock on Your Android"></a>Way 1. Disabling Google Smart Lock on Your Android</h3><p>To deactivate Google Smart Lock on your Android device, you can use Chrome. Google Chrome is the main hub for storing all your login credentials for websites and apps. This provides the quickest way to disable Google Smart Lock. To disable Google Smart Lock from the Chrome app on your Android device, follow these steps:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1.</strong> Begin by opening the Google Chrome app on your Android device. Then, tap the “three dots” icon from the top right corner and press “Settings.”</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/guide-to-remove-or-disable-google-smart-lock-2.jpg"                      alt="access settings on google chrome android"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 2.</strong> Within the Settings, choose “Passwords,” and on the following screen, look for the “Save passwords” and “Auto Sign-in” options.

Removing Google Smart Lock From Android Settings"></a>Way 2. Removing Google Smart Lock From Android Settings</h3><p>Google Smart Lock enables users to keep their phones unlocked under specific, pre-approved, and secure conditions. This simplifies device usage by eliminating the need to input passwords or security codes. The basic working of this aspect of Google Smart Lock, now known as “Extend Unlock,” is divided into three parts.</p><p>The first one is on-body detection, which keeps the Meizu 21 Pro device unlocked when it’s carried or held by the user.

Even though modern Android smartphones come with fingerprint recognition and face recognition technologies, there exists a large subset of users still addicted to and acclimatized with the pattern lock feature, opting over fingerprint and face recognition.</p><p>There has been, however, research conducted into the safety and security offered by pattern lock in Android.</p><h3 id="I-III-Advantages-and-Drawbacks"><a href="#I-III-Advantages-and-Drawbacks" class="headerlink" title="I.III: Advantages and Drawbacks"></a>I.III: Advantages and Drawbacks</h3><p>Modern smartphones very nearly contain the entirety of our lives; photo memories, video memories, important documents both financial and personal in nature, banking apps, ID and ATM&#x2F; credit cards in the “wallet” apps, and whatnot. A smartphone falling into the wrong hands could very nearly be used to devastate the rightful owner, both financially and otherwise. And this is not a claim out of thin air; spyware&#x2F; malware&#x2F; phishing attacks are on the rise around the world. Locking the smartphone, once considered optional and an unnecessary hassle, is now an absolute must.</p><h4 id="Advantages-of-Pattern-Locks"><a href="#Advantages-of-Pattern-Locks" class="headerlink" title="Advantages of Pattern Locks"></a>Advantages of Pattern Locks</h4><p>There is no denying that using an <strong>easy pattern lock</strong> to lock their smartphone seems enough for most users. Swiping your finger across your smartphone to unlock it feels not only cool and futuristic but safer and more secure than remembering and punching in digits. And, for the most part, it is true, given that 4-digit PINs can only have 10,000 unique combinations!</p><h4 id="Disadvantages-of-Pattern-Locks"><a href="#Disadvantages-of-Pattern-Locks" class="headerlink" title="Disadvantages of Pattern Locks"></a>Disadvantages of Pattern Locks</h4><p>While very easy to use, security researchers and experts have come to agree that the feature is not in the least safe to use, and that is because of how people use the pattern lock feature (discussed in detail below in part II). Some go so far as to say that most pattern locks can be breached in just 5 attempts or less. Imagine that!</p><p>What is more, research has found that humans have an uncanny ability to correctly guess a pattern lock simply by viewing the unlocking! The test comprised showing the test subjects videos of users unlocking their phones from different angles and varying distances, and it was found that around 64% of test subjects were able to correctly guess a 6-point pattern lock in one viewing only, and 80% could correctly guess the pattern after just two viewings. By contrast, only 11% were able to correctly deduce a 6-digit PIN after one viewing, and only 27% after viewing twice. This goes to show just how insecure pattern locks are!</p><h2 id="Part-II-How-People-Use-Pattern-Locks"><a href="#Part-II-How-People-Use-Pattern-Locks" class="headerlink" title="Part II: How People Use Pattern Locks"></a>Part II: How People Use Pattern Locks</h2><p>We might wonder how anyone would be able to guess the correct pattern of our device, but believe it or not, it is possible, eerily easily at that! We are all the same humans, after all! You know how people usually set PINs that could be significant dates in their lives? How they get car registration numbers that mean something to them? The same ‘logic’ applies to their setting pattern locks.</p><p>At DEFCON 23, Marte Loge, an M.Sc. Computer Science student, presented something that stunned people around the world. She said, “Tell me who you are, and I will tell you your lock pattern.” What followed was an expert presentation outlining and detailing user behaviors around pattern locks.</p><p>These are some commonly created pattern locks by people:</p><ul><li>- shapes of alphabets,</li><li>- shapes of numerals,</li><li>- any other easy-to-make, simple shape.</li></ul><p>Marte Loge presented the image below, showing how people naturally gravitate towards creating simple shape patterns, in her research.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/09/easy-pattern-lock-2.jpg"                      alt="common pattern locks"                ></p><p>To further help you see how easy it might be for anyone to guess your pattern, Marte Loge also presented some statistics.</p><ul><li>- 77% of people started their patterns in one of the 4 corners.</li><li>- 44% of Loge’s subjects started their pattern with the first dot, the top-left one. The next number was 15% for the top-right and 14% for the bottom-left.</li><li>- These percentages did not vary much depending on left-handedness or right-handedness.</li><li>- On average, irrespective of gender, people set 5-point patterns, with 4-point patterns being the most common. This means that the number of combinations on average was 7152 for 5-point patterns and a bogglingly low 1624 for 4-point patterns.</li></ul><p>The above data makes it amply clear how using an <strong>easy pattern lock</strong> is actually worse than using a 4-digit PIN, simply because how people are usually using the pattern lock feature.</p><h2 id="Part-III-Tips-For-Using-More-Secure-Pattern-Locks"><a href="#Part-III-Tips-For-Using-More-Secure-Pattern-Locks" class="headerlink" title="Part III: Tips For Using More Secure Pattern Locks"></a>Part III: Tips For Using More Secure Pattern Locks</h2><p>Now, we know how hard it is to break habits cemented over years of use, so in case you must at all costs use a pattern lock only, the least you can do is try and change your easy pattern lock to a better, more secure hard pattern lock.</p><h4 id="III-I-How-to-Create-More-Secure-Patterns"><a href="#III-I-How-to-Create-More-Secure-Patterns" class="headerlink" title="III.I: How to Create More Secure Patterns"></a>III.I: How to Create More Secure Patterns</h4><p>Here are some tips to help you create a better, more secure pattern lock for your smartphone.</p><ul><li>- Avoid using any of the corners to start the pattern.</li><li>- Never use your first initial as a pattern.</li><li>- Never use a digit shape as a pattern.</li><li>- You can pass through the same pattern lines multiple times over. This makes it more difficult for someone to guess your pattern correctly.</li><li>- Use all 9 points on the grid while setting the pattern lock! That simple act takes the possible pattern combinations to over 140,000, significantly more than 10,000 for 4-digit PINs, and vastly superior to paltry 1624 for a 4-point <strong>easy pattern lock</strong>!</li></ul><h4 id="III-II-Forgot-Your-Pattern-Unlock-Your-Asus-ROG-Phone-7-Ultimate-Without-Pattern-Lock-With-Dr-Fone"><a href="#III-II-Forgot-Your-Pattern-Unlock-Your-Asus-ROG-Phone-7-Ultimate-Without-Pattern-Lock-With-Dr-Fone" class="headerlink" title="III.II: Forgot Your Pattern?

After affirming the Delete capability, your phone will boot into recovery and begin playing out a production line reset.

If you want to know how to do so, you can do a speed search on the internet.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Access the safe mode, use the volume keys to navigate, and press the Power key to click.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Search for the Wipe Data option and select it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/set-screen-lock-3.jpg"                      alt="wipe data"                ></p><p>After that, your Android will start the process, which can require a few minutes. However, this process will erase all your user data.</p><h3 id="3-Use-ADB"><a href="#3-Use-ADB" class="headerlink" title="3. Use ADB"></a>3. Use ADB</h3><p>This method is very confusing, so follow the steps cautiously on your Android phone to remove the <strong>phone lock</strong>.

Boot into Safe Mode"></a>4. Boot into Safe Mode</h3><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> For most phones and your Android, you can do this by opening the power menu and holding the “Power Off.” A message will spring up on your screen, asking whether you might want to Reboot to Safe Mode. Press Ok.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Clear data from your lock screen application, uninstall and reboot your phone to escape the Safe mode. When you do so, your Android <strong>screen lock</strong> will unlock.</p><h3 id="5-Crash-Lock-Screen"><a href="#5-Crash-Lock-Screen" class="headerlink" title="5. Crash Lock Screen"></a>5.

So how do you bypass face unlock?</p><p>Follow the guide below to bypass the face unlock settings and choose the best one for yourself.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/face-unlock-android-1.jpg"                      alt="face lock"                ></p><h2 id="How-To-Bypass-Android-Face-Lock-by-Ourselves"><a href="#How-To-Bypass-Android-Face-Lock-by-Ourselves" class="headerlink" title="How To Bypass Android Face Lock by Ourselves?"></a>How To Bypass Android Face Lock by Ourselves?</h2><p>If you want to bypass face lock by yourself, then different methods can help you. These are all tested and work well.</p><h3 id="1-A-Picture-Possibly-Bypasses-Face-Lock"><a href="#1-A-Picture-Possibly-Bypasses-Face-Lock" class="headerlink" title="1.

A Picture Possibly Bypasses Face Lock</h3><p>You can use your photo to manipulate the face lock app. Simply use your photo to unlock the phone, which should work fine. If your phone doesn’t recognize your face from a photo, try again.</p><p>If it still doesn’t recognize your face, try a different photo or even change the camera’s lighting settings or the angles to see if that helps.</p><p>Anyway, this method is still unstable because of many uncontrollable factors. If everything fails, consider the following methods to bypass the face lock.</p><h3 id="2-Hard-Reset-your-phone"><a href="#2-Hard-Reset-your-phone" class="headerlink" title="2. Hard Reset your phone"></a>2. Hard Reset your phone</h3><p>To get around the Android lock screen, perform a factory reset. While resetting your phone allows you to set a new password, it also erases all data from your device. This method works like a charm, but it also requires more technical knowledge. To bypass screen lock via factory reset, follow these steps.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/face-unlock-android-2.jpg"                      alt="android hard reset"                ></p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Turn off your phone and hold the Power and Volume-down buttons simultaneously until the recovery mode screen appears. There are minor variations depending on the brand and model.</p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Select the Wipe data&#x2F;Factory Reset option using the volume buttons. To confirm the option, press the Power button.</p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Choose Yes &gt; Delete All User Data, then press the power button to continue. When the process is complete, turn on your phone.</p><p>So, before facing such awkward cases, like data loss, we suggest you have a backup habit of keeping your data safe.</p><h3 id="3-Google-Find-My-Device"><a href="#3-Google-Find-My-Device" class="headerlink" title="3. Google Find My Device"></a>3. Google Find My Device</h3><p>Google Find My Device is a service that lets you remotely lock, track, and wipe data from stolen or lost phones. With a Google account and the password, it won’t be complicated to remove any locks on your phone. You can bypass the Android lock screen by following the steps below:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/face-unlock-android-3.jpg"                      alt="google find my device data reset"                ></p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Navigate to Find My Device and sign in with your Google account.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Your phone receives a notification.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Select Erase Device, confirm, and click Erase as a warning pops up on the screen.</p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> The factory reset process on your phone begins. When it’s finished, choose My Google Account instead of using your phone as if it were brand new.</p><p>Just like the hard reset, after using Google Find My Device, all your data and settings will be erased. Please make everything well prepared before you decide to unlock your device.</p><h2 id="Easiest-Way-to-Unlock-Your-Android-Face-Recognition-Using-Dr-Fone-Screen-unlock"><a href="#Easiest-Way-to-Unlock-Your-Android-Face-Recognition-Using-Dr-Fone-Screen-unlock" class="headerlink" title="Easiest Way to Unlock Your Android Face Recognition Using Dr.Fone-Screen unlock"></a>Easiest Way to Unlock Your Android Face Recognition Using Dr.Fone-Screen unlock</h2><p>The methods mentioned above may be hard for you, and you don’t know any technical skills.

However, pattern locks are easy to crack, and today, we bring you all you want to know about pattern locks and how to create a <strong>hard pattern lock</strong>. Further to this, we also tell you how to move beyond pattern locks and what to do in case you forgot the hard pattern lock you just set and are unable to unlock your smartphone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/09/hard-pattern-lock-1.jpg"                      alt="creating more secure pattern locks"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-You-Need-to-Know-About-Pattern-Locks"><a href="#Part-1-What-You-Need-to-Know-About-Pattern-Locks" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What You Need to Know About Pattern Locks"></a>Part 1: What You Need to Know About Pattern Locks</h2><p>Pattern lock is an Android-only feature that makes it easy for users to have a modicum of security on their smartphones. Most users do not prefer using and remembering a PIN to unlock the smartphone. Creating a pattern makes it easier, somehow.</p><p>There is a 9-point grid on which you swipe your finger from point to point, in any direction, and when you take your finger off, that pattern you swiped becomes the key to unlock your smartphone.</p><p>Pattern locks were exceedingly common only a few years ago, and they are not recommended for use any longer due to concerns (mentioned later in the article).</p><h3 id="1-1-Popularity-and-Usage"><a href="#1-1-Popularity-and-Usage" class="headerlink" title="1.1: Popularity and Usage"></a>1.1: Popularity and Usage</h3><p>Old habits die hard, or so they say, right? That’s because it is true. We are creatures of habit, and pattern locks have been around for a long, long time. We are accustomed to pattern locks. So, even with even easier technologies such as fingerprint recognition and face recognition, we tend to gravitate towards the familiar old pattern lock.</p><p>The only thing is, there is a reason why pattern locks are no longer the preferred option to use for unlocking your smartphones. As it happens, that reason is security, and it can be very easy for humans to take a swipe (pardon the pun) at your pattern lock. And guess what? The research conducted suggests that they would get it right with an unsettling accuracy.</p><h3 id="1-2-Advantages-and-Drawbacks"><a href="#1-2-Advantages-and-Drawbacks" class="headerlink" title="1.2: Advantages and Drawbacks"></a>1.2: Advantages and Drawbacks</h3><p>With on-the-go lifestyles, our smartphones have become indispensable and contain some of the most sensitive aspects of our lives – IDs, credit and debit cards in digital wallets, photo and video memories, business documents – you name it, the smartphones have it, on the go. This has opened our lives up to the public at large, and if someone steals our smartphone or, best case, finds it, the only barrier preventing them from being privy to all that wealth of our sensitive information is that screen lock – the pattern lock that we set on our smartphones. That’s it – the single pattern lock stands between malicious actors and our data. You might be beginning to realize just how crazy this is.</p><h4 id="Advantages-of-Pattern-Locks"><a href="#Advantages-of-Pattern-Locks" class="headerlink" title="Advantages of Pattern Locks"></a>Advantages of Pattern Locks</h4><p>There are two advantages to using pattern locks. One, they are better than nothing. Two, they are easy to use. And that’s about it. There is no third advantage to pattern locks. We might think we set a hard pattern lock that nobody could guess, but, as research proves, we might be thinking too low of human prowess.</p><h4 id="Disadvantages-of-Pattern-Locks"><a href="#Disadvantages-of-Pattern-Locks" class="headerlink" title="Disadvantages of Pattern Locks"></a>Disadvantages of Pattern Locks</h4><p>Security, or rather, the lack of it, is the lone disadvantage of using a pattern lock. What good is a pattern lock that can be easily deciphered? Sure, they are easy to use, and they are better than not having anything, but would you really want to protect your life’s data with something that could be, as researchers found out, breached in under 5 attempts? We don’t think you do!</p><p>The research found that 64% of test subjects who were shown videos of people unlocking their phones could correctly guess a 6-point pattern lock, that too after viewing the video only once! That number shot up to 80% if they were allowed to see the video again. That is simply astounding and a nightmare for security. When it comes to PINs, only 11% could guess a 6-digit PIN after viewing the unlocking video once, and that number shot up to 27% when they could see the video two times.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-To-Create-a-Hard-Pattern-Lock-Including-Remembering-Complex-Patterns"><a href="#Part-2-How-To-Create-a-Hard-Pattern-Lock-Including-Remembering-Complex-Patterns" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How To Create a Hard Pattern Lock (Including Remembering Complex Patterns)"></a>Part 2: How To Create a Hard Pattern Lock (Including Remembering Complex Patterns)</h2><p>Now, if you must continue using a pattern lock, let’s help you know how to create a hard pattern lock that would not be as easy to decipher as easy pattern locks. For that, you should know how people use pattern locks, the kind of pattern locks they create, and the ones that are the most commonly used pattern locks. That way, you can avoid those fallacies and create a hard pattern lock for your smartphone.</p><h3 id="2-1-The-Pattern-Locks-People-Use-Most-Commonly"><a href="#2-1-The-Pattern-Locks-People-Use-Most-Commonly" class="headerlink" title="2.1: The Pattern Locks People Use Most Commonly"></a>2.1: The Pattern Locks People Use Most Commonly</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/09/hard-pattern-lock-2.jpg"                      alt="common pattern locks"                ></p><p>Marte Loge, an M.Sc. Computer Science student, gave a presentation on pattern locks at DEFCON 23 and made a bold claim. She said, “Tell me who you are, and I will tell you your lock pattern.”</p><p>She presented the following statistics to support her claim:</p><ul><li>- In her research, she found that 77% of people started with one of the 4 corners when creating a pattern lock.</li><li>- 44% of people started with the top-left dot and 15% with the top-right, while the bottom-left was preferred by 14% of her test subjects.</li><li>- People set 5-point pattern locks on average, and most users were content with a 4-point pattern.</li></ul><p>These are some of the most common pattern locks people create:</p><ul><li>- patterns in the shapes of alphabets,</li><li>- patterns in the shapes of numerals,</li><li>- patterns in any other simple shape, such as square, triangle, star, etc.</li></ul><p>To understand how this is a security nightmare, the possible combinations for a 4-point pattern are a measly 1624, whereas by adding just 1 more point to the pattern and creating a 5-point pattern, the number of possible combinations becomes 7152, an increase of 5528 combinations. In stark contrast, creating a 9-point pattern would give you over 140,000 possible combinations!</p><h3 id="2-2-How-to-Create-a-Hard-Pattern-Lock"><a href="#2-2-How-to-Create-a-Hard-Pattern-Lock" class="headerlink" title="2.2: How to Create a Hard Pattern Lock"></a>2.2: How to Create a Hard Pattern Lock</h3><p>Knowing what most people do when creating a pattern lock, it becomes easy to avoid those mistakes and instead create a hard pattern lock for oneself.</p><ul><li>- Do not start creating a pattern lock from any of the 4 corners of the grid.</li><li>- Never use your first initial as your pattern lock.</li><li>- Never use the shape of a numeral as your pattern lock.</li><li>- Use all 9 points on the grid to create your pattern lock, and contrary to popular belief, you can go over the connecting lines several times, creating a hard pattern lock that would not be as easy for people to decipher!</li></ul><h2 id="Part-3-Going-Beyond-Pattern-Locks"><a href="#Part-3-Going-Beyond-Pattern-Locks" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Going Beyond Pattern Locks"></a>Part 3: Going Beyond Pattern Locks</h2><p>You might think that now that you have set a hard pattern lock, you are good to go.

Using fingerprint recognition requires you to set a 6-digit PIN and then set a fingerprint to unlock your device. You can set additional fingerprints, too.</p><p>This way, your device is the most secure it can be today. In case your fingerprint is not recognized for any reason, the phone falls back on the 6-digit PIN that you can enter and unlock your phone.</p><p>While face recognition is available on both Android and Apple devices, it is truly secure only on Apple devices. This is why Apple iPhones released after the iPhone X in 2017 have come only with Face ID.

Use Password Managers</strong>: Consider using reputable password manager apps that securely store and manage your passwords. These apps often have features to generate strong, unique passwords for different accounts and help you remember them.</li><li><strong>2. Set up Biometric Authentication</strong>: In case your device supports it, use biometric authentication methods for a better experience. These can be fingerprints or facial recognition. These methods can be more convenient than remembering passwords and offer added security.</li><li><strong>3. Create Memorable Passwords</strong>: If you opt against using a password manager, craft robust yet easily remembered passwords. To improve your security, try to use a sequence of lowercase and uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols. Plus, avoid easily guessable details like birthdays or common phrases to make your password strong.</li><li><strong>4. Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)</strong>: Enable two-factor authentication whenever possible for your accounts. Likewise, this provides an added layer of security by requiring a secondary verification method. It could be a text message code or authentication app in addition to your password.</li><li><strong>5. Regularly Back Up Your Data</strong>: Make it a habit to consistently <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/android-backup-and-restore/" >back up your device data <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. To prevent potential data loss from forgotten passwords or unexpected issues, take precautions. Safeguard your crucial data by creating backups, whether in the cloud or on an external storage device.</li></ul><h2 id="Conclusion-2"><a href="#Conclusion-2" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>This article guided all the possible ways available in 2024 to reset your Android lock screen password, such as using the Smart Lock, Google Find My, Samsung SmartThings, and Wondershare Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (Android).

The other side of the coin is, however, not as appealing. Thanks to the different carrier services, network locking is the commonest issue of recent mobile launches. Users have reported of Motorola Moto G13 phones refusing to work with different carriers.</p><p>The issue limits the smartphone’s functioning to the specific carrier from whom the Motorola Moto G13 device is purchased. Consequently, there are annoying connectivity problems that restrict seamless mobile usage. The problem aggravates in geo-restricted regions where the carrier options are quite limited. This scenario puts forward the need for <strong>Motorola Moto G13 network unlock</strong> solutions.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/08/how-to-unlock-a-network-locked-oneplus-phone-01.jpg"                      alt="unlock a network locked Motorola Moto G13 phone"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Does-It-Mean-When-Your-Motorola-Moto-G13-Phone-is-Network-Locked"><a href="#Part-1-What-Does-It-Mean-When-Your-Motorola-Moto-G13-Phone-is-Network-Locked" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Does It Mean When Your Motorola Moto G13 Phone is Network Locked?"></a>Part 1: What Does It Mean When Your Motorola Moto G13 Phone is Network Locked?</h2><p>In the simplest words, a network-locked Motorola Moto G13 phone means that your device has become carrier-specific.

Another problem is that there is no automatic unlocking even after the expiry of your contract with the carrier service. Having a network-locked Motorola Moto G13 phone poses undesired connectivity issues.</p><h3 id="1-Why-is-my-phone-locked-to-the-network-carrier"><a href="#1-Why-is-my-phone-locked-to-the-network-carrier" class="headerlink" title="1.

Why is my phone locked to the network carrier?</h3><p>Smartphones are network locked by carrier services to prevent customers from switching to a different carrier.
