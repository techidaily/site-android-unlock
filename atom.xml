Tips, Tricks and Helpful Advice"></a>Still Using Pattern Locks with Lenovo ThinkPhone? Tips, Tricks and Helpful Advice</h2><p>They have been along for a long, long time now – pattern locks – the easiest of all smartphone locks. You just swipe your finger across to create an <strong>easy pattern lock</strong> of your choosing and that’s it, it becomes your new screen lock. No more remembering tedious digits! So, why have these easy pattern locks become outdated, and why do people still continue to use them? Let’s take a dive and find out all about pattern locks.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/09/easy-pattern-lock-1.jpg"                      alt="creating more secure pattern locks"                ></p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Part-I-Things-To-Know-About-Pattern-Locks"><a href="#Part-I-Things-To-Know-About-Pattern-Locks" class="headerlink" title="Part I: Things To Know About Pattern Locks"></a>Part I: Things To Know About Pattern Locks</h2><p>The first cellphone locks were 4-digit number locks. Then came 6-digit codes, and even alphanumeric ones. Pattern locks were all the rage a while ago. Though pattern locks continue to be used, they are not considered safe to use any longer. What is all that about? Here’s what you need to know about pattern locks, whether you are a seasoned pattern lock user or not.</p><h3 id="I-I-What-Are-Pattern-Locks"><a href="#I-I-What-Are-Pattern-Locks" class="headerlink" title="I.I: What Are Pattern Locks?"></a>I.I: What Are Pattern Locks?</h3><p>Believe it or not, technology has advanced at such a rapid pace in the last two decades that you’d be forgiven if you don’t know what a pattern lock is, especially if you have only ever used iPhones, or Android phones in just the last few years.</p><p>Pattern locks are patterns you create on your smartphone and designate as a smartphone lock&#x2F; screen lock. There is a 9-point keypad of sorts, and you start swiping your finger from any point to any point for any which way you feel like. Android 13 allows a minimum of 4 points registered. They are easy to create, and easy to use, hence called easy pattern locks.</p><p>Pattern locks have only ever been offered on Android devices and were commonplace a few years ago until they were deemed not secure enough for use by modern standards because they were <em>easy</em> to figure out by malicious actors.</p><h3 id="I-II-Popularity-and-Usage"><a href="#I-II-Popularity-and-Usage" class="headerlink" title="I.II: Popularity and Usage"></a>I.II: Popularity and Usage</h3><p>Pattern lock is a feature unique to Android and has been so since the start. Naturally, it is one of the preferred ways users have come to unlock their Android devices over the years. Even though modern Android smartphones come with fingerprint recognition and face recognition technologies, there exists a large subset of users still addicted to and acclimatized with the pattern lock feature, opting over fingerprint and face recognition.</p><p>There has been, however, research conducted into the safety and security offered by pattern lock in Android.</p><h3 id="I-III-Advantages-and-Drawbacks"><a href="#I-III-Advantages-and-Drawbacks" class="headerlink" title="I.III: Advantages and Drawbacks"></a>I.III: Advantages and Drawbacks</h3><p>Modern smartphones very nearly contain the entirety of our lives; photo memories, video memories, important documents both financial and personal in nature, banking apps, ID and ATM&#x2F; credit cards in the “wallet” apps, and whatnot. A smartphone falling into the wrong hands could very nearly be used to devastate the rightful owner, both financially and otherwise. And this is not a claim out of thin air; spyware&#x2F; malware&#x2F; phishing attacks are on the rise around the world. Locking the smartphone, once considered optional and an unnecessary hassle, is now an absolute must.</p><h4 id="Advantages-of-Pattern-Locks"><a href="#Advantages-of-Pattern-Locks" class="headerlink" title="Advantages of Pattern Locks"></a>Advantages of Pattern Locks</h4><p>There is no denying that using an <strong>easy pattern lock</strong> to lock their smartphone seems enough for most users. Swiping your finger across your smartphone to unlock it feels not only cool and futuristic but safer and more secure than remembering and punching in digits. And, for the most part, it is true, given that 4-digit PINs can only have 10,000 unique combinations!</p><h4 id="Disadvantages-of-Pattern-Locks"><a href="#Disadvantages-of-Pattern-Locks" class="headerlink" title="Disadvantages of Pattern Locks"></a>Disadvantages of Pattern Locks</h4><p>While very easy to use, security researchers and experts have come to agree that the feature is not in the least safe to use, and that is because of how people use the pattern lock feature (discussed in detail below in part II). Some go so far as to say that most pattern locks can be breached in just 5 attempts or less. Imagine that!</p><p>What is more, research has found that humans have an uncanny ability to correctly guess a pattern lock simply by viewing the unlocking! The test comprised showing the test subjects videos of users unlocking their phones from different angles and varying distances, and it was found that around 64% of test subjects were able to correctly guess a 6-point pattern lock in one viewing only, and 80% could correctly guess the pattern after just two viewings. By contrast, only 11% were able to correctly deduce a 6-digit PIN after one viewing, and only 27% after viewing twice. This goes to show just how insecure pattern locks are!</p><h2 id="Part-II-How-People-Use-Pattern-Locks"><a href="#Part-II-How-People-Use-Pattern-Locks" class="headerlink" title="Part II: How People Use Pattern Locks"></a>Part II: How People Use Pattern Locks</h2><p>We might wonder how anyone would be able to guess the correct pattern of our device, but believe it or not, it is possible, eerily easily at that! We are all the same humans, after all! You know how people usually set PINs that could be significant dates in their lives? How they get car registration numbers that mean something to them? The same ‘logic’ applies to their setting pattern locks.</p><p>At DEFCON 23, Marte Loge, an M.Sc. Computer Science student, presented something that stunned people around the world. She said, “Tell me who you are, and I will tell you your lock pattern.” What followed was an expert presentation outlining and detailing user behaviors around pattern locks.</p><p>These are some commonly created pattern locks by people:</p><ul><li>- shapes of alphabets,</li><li>- shapes of numerals,</li><li>- any other easy-to-make, simple shape.</li></ul><p>Marte Loge presented the image below, showing how people naturally gravitate towards creating simple shape patterns, in her research.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/09/easy-pattern-lock-2.jpg"                      alt="common pattern locks"                ></p><p>To further help you see how easy it might be for anyone to guess your pattern, Marte Loge also presented some statistics.</p><ul><li>- 77% of people started their patterns in one of the 4 corners.</li><li>- 44% of Loge’s subjects started their pattern with the first dot, the top-left one. The next number was 15% for the top-right and 14% for the bottom-left.</li><li>- These percentages did not vary much depending on left-handedness or right-handedness.</li><li>- On average, irrespective of gender, people set 5-point patterns, with 4-point patterns being the most common. This means that the number of combinations on average was 7152 for 5-point patterns and a bogglingly low 1624 for 4-point patterns.</li></ul><p>The above data makes it amply clear how using an <strong>easy pattern lock</strong> is actually worse than using a 4-digit PIN, simply because how people are usually using the pattern lock feature.</p><h2 id="Part-III-Tips-For-Using-More-Secure-Pattern-Locks"><a href="#Part-III-Tips-For-Using-More-Secure-Pattern-Locks" class="headerlink" title="Part III: Tips For Using More Secure Pattern Locks"></a>Part III: Tips For Using More Secure Pattern Locks</h2><p>Now, we know how hard it is to break habits cemented over years of use, so in case you must at all costs use a pattern lock only, the least you can do is try and change your easy pattern lock to a better, more secure hard pattern lock.</p><h4 id="III-I-How-to-Create-More-Secure-Patterns"><a href="#III-I-How-to-Create-More-Secure-Patterns" class="headerlink" title="III.I: How to Create More Secure Patterns"></a>III.I: How to Create More Secure Patterns</h4><p>Here are some tips to help you create a better, more secure pattern lock for your smartphone.</p><ul><li>- Avoid using any of the corners to start the pattern.</li><li>- Never use your first initial as a pattern.</li><li>- Never use a digit shape as a pattern.</li><li>- You can pass through the same pattern lines multiple times over. This makes it more difficult for someone to guess your pattern correctly.</li><li>- Use all 9 points on the grid while setting the pattern lock! That simple act takes the possible pattern combinations to over 140,000, significantly more than 10,000 for 4-digit PINs, and vastly superior to paltry 1624 for a 4-point <strong>easy pattern lock</strong>!</li></ul><h4 id="III-II-Forgot-Your-Pattern-Unlock-Your-Lenovo-ThinkPhone-Without-Pattern-Lock-With-Dr-Fone"><a href="#III-II-Forgot-Your-Pattern-Unlock-Your-Lenovo-ThinkPhone-Without-Pattern-Lock-With-Dr-Fone" class="headerlink" title="III.II: Forgot Your Pattern? Unlock Your Lenovo ThinkPhone Without Pattern Lock With Dr.Fone"></a>III.II: Forgot Your Pattern?

Nevertheless, if your device hasn’t been updated and you are using an Android 4.4 or previous version, then you can bypass the forgot pattern lock by following these steps:</p><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Firstly, provide the wrong pattern to your device. It will let you know that you applied the incorrect pattern.</p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> On the same prompt, you can see an option of “Forgot pattern” on the bottom.

Here’s How You Can Unlock Meizu 21 Pattern Lock Screen"></a>Forgot Pattern Lock? Here’s How You Can Unlock Meizu 21 Pattern Lock Screen</h2><p>Forgetting the pattern lock of a device and getting locked out of it is probably one of the most frustrating scenarios faced by Android users. Nevertheless, unlike popular operating systems, Android provides a seamless way to past the forgot pattern lock feature.</p><p>You can either try Google’s native solution or a third-party tool in case you have forgotten the pattern lock on your device and reset it. In no time, you will be able to access your device (or even someone else’s phone by following these techniques). To make things easier for you, we have provided three simple solutions to resolve forgotten patterns on Android devices.</p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/68FqgS6Ym8E" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-bypass-forgot-pattern-lock-using-the-‘Forgot-Pattern’-feature"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-bypass-forgot-pattern-lock-using-the-‘Forgot-Pattern’-feature" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to bypass forgot pattern lock using the ‘Forgot Pattern’ feature?"></a>Part 1: How to bypass forgot pattern lock using the ‘Forgot Pattern’ feature?</h2><p>One of the easiest and fastest ways to fix the forgot pattern lock issue on a device is by using its inbuilt “Forgot Pattern” feature. If you are using an Android 4.4 or earlier version, then you can simply access this feature. Since users can hack an Android device just by knowing the Google credentials of the connected device, the solution was later discontinued (as it was considered a security vulnerability). Nevertheless, if your device hasn’t been updated and you are using an Android 4.4 or previous version, then you can bypass the forgot pattern lock by following these steps:</p><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Firstly, provide the wrong pattern to your device. It will let you know that you applied the incorrect pattern.</p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> On the same prompt, you can see an option of “Forgot pattern” on the bottom. Simply tap on it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/09/15059289368742.jpg"                      alt="forgot pattern"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3.</strong> This will open a new screen, which can be used to bypass the forgotten pattern of Android. Select the option for entering the Google Account details and proceed.</p><p><strong>Step 4.</strong> To reset the forgot pattern lock, you need to provide the correct Google credentials of the account already linked to the Meizu 21 device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/09/15059290192675.jpg"                      alt="enter google account"                ></p><p><strong>Step 5.</strong> After signing in to the interface, you will be asked to provide a new pattern lock for the Meizu 21 device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/09/15059290477717.jpg"                      alt="draw an unlock pattern"                ></p><p><strong>Step 6.</strong> Confirm your choice and set a new pattern lock on your device.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-get-past-forgot-pattern-lock-using-Dr-Fone-Screen-Unlock-Android"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-get-past-forgot-pattern-lock-using-Dr-Fone-Screen-Unlock-Android" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to get past forgot pattern lock using Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (Android)?"></a>Part 2: How to get past forgot pattern lock using Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (Android)?</h2><p>One of the major drawbacks of the “Forgot pattern” feature is that it doesn’t work on new Android devices. Since most of the Meizu 21 devices out there have been updated, the technique has been outdated. Therefore, you can simply take the assistance of <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare-dr-fone-unlock-android-screen/" >Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (Android) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to bypass the forgot pattern lock on your device.

Nothing could be more frustrating than gazing at your phone, knowing that it is essentially a paperweight at this point. Unless you can get it unlocked, your phone is useless, and all of your important photos, text messages, and content are all locked out of your reach. While right now, nothing can do without a Google account. But you can try to reset your Google account first.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Bypass-Lock-Screen-on-Android-device-with-Google-Account-Android-Device-Manager"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Bypass-Lock-Screen-on-Android-device-with-Google-Account-Android-Device-Manager" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to Bypass Lock Screen on Android device with Google Account (Android Device Manager)"></a>Part 1: How to Bypass Lock Screen on Android device with Google Account (Android Device Manager)</h2><p>Even if you have a Google account, if your phone isn’t connected to the internet, you cannot access it to unlock your phone. If this sounds familiar, you can always try this method.</p><p>1. First, navigate to the Android Device Manager page. You will need to sign in with the Google account that you use to set up your phone.</p><p>Android Device Manager link: <a class="link"   href="http://www.google.com/android/devicemanager" >http://www.google.com/android/devicemanager <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14637942446007.jpg"                      alt="android Device Manager log in"                ></p><p>2. Once you have logged in, you will automatically be redirected to the Android Device Manager page. If this is your first time, click the “Accept” button.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14637942473262.jpg"                      alt="android Device Manager start"                ></p><p>3. A list of all of the Motorola G54 5G devices registered to this Android account will pop up. Select the Motorola G54 5G device in question from this list.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14637942503282.jpg"                      alt="android Device Manager list of devices"                ></p><p>4. The Android Device Manager will then locate your device. Make sure it is turned on!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14637942532352.jpg"                      alt="android Device Manager locating device"                ></p><p>5. After it has been located, you will have a few options for what to do next. If you do not know your phone’s location, you can call it from this screen, but if you know where it is, click the ‘Enable Lock &amp; Erase’ option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14637942568385.jpg"                      alt="android Device Manager device located"                ></p><p>6. A notification will pop up on your device; confirm it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14637942582896.jpg"                      alt="android Device Manager Erase &amp; Lock"                ></p><p>7. At this point, you will be asked to create a new lock screen password. Once you have chosen one, press “Lock.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14637943377629.jpg"                      alt="android Device Manager New Lock Screen"                ></p><p>8. Now, simply enter the new passcode on your device, and voila! It will open, and you can get back to your daily routine.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Reset-Your-Google-Account-on-your-Android-Phone"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Reset-Your-Google-Account-on-your-Android-Phone" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Reset Your Google Account on your Android Phone"></a>Part 2: How to Reset Your Google Account on your Android Phone</h2><p>If you have forgotten your Google Account password, it is still possible to unlock your account and access the information within. Here is how you can unlock your Google account on your Android phone.</p><p>1. On your browser, go to the Google home page and try to sign in. You will fail, but that is good! It will lead you to the next step.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14637535742329.jpg"                      alt="android Google web page"                ></p><p>2. Since you cannot sign in on the sign-in page, you can now select the ‘Help’ link.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14637535763672.jpg"                      alt="android Goodle log in"                ></p><p>3. Choose the “forgot password” option. You will be prompted to enter your email address to proceed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14637535788151.jpg"                      alt="android Google trouble signing in"                ></p><p>4. Two options will then appear: the first is your phone number, and the other asks you for your backup email.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14637535828239.jpg"                      alt="android Google forgot password"                ><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14637535857339.jpg"                      alt="android Google forgot pssword enter email"                ></p><p>5. Enter either one of these options, and you will receive a verification code via email, SMS, or a telephone call from an operator. If you have chosen to enter your backup email, at this point, you will receive detailed instructions on how to access the ‘reset password’ page.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14637561923476.jpg"                      alt="android Google automated call verification"                ><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14637561995841.jpg"                      alt="android Google automated call verification"                ></p><p>6.

Finally, you can unlock your Google account on your Android! Confirm this by clicking the “Change Password” button.

Password cracking term refers to group of techniques used to get password from a data system.</p><p>Purpose and reason of password cracking includes gaining an unauthorized access to a computer system or it can be recovery of forgotten password. There might be another reason of using password cracking technique that is for testing password strength so hacker could not hack into system.</p><p>Password cracking is normally performed thought repetitive process in which computer applies different combinations of password till the exact match.</p><p><strong>Brute Force Password Cracking:</strong></p><p>Term brute force password cracking may also be referred as brute force attack. Brute force password cracking is respective process of guessing password, in this process software or tool creates a large number of password combinations. Basically it’s a trail-and-error technique used by software to obtain password information from system.</p><p>A brute force attack are normally used by hackers when there is no chance of taking advantage of encrypted system weakness or by security analysis experts to test an organization’s network security .This method of password cracking is very fast for short length passwords but for long length passwords <a class="link"   href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictionary_attack" >dictionary attack <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> technique is normally used.</p><p>Time taken by brute force password cracking software to crack password is normally depend upon speed of system and internet connection.</p><p><strong>GPU Password Cracking:</strong></p><p><a class="link"   href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit" >GPU <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is graphics processing unit, sometimes also called visual processing unit.

Brute force password cracking is respective process of guessing password, in this process software or tool creates a large number of password combinations. Basically it’s a trail-and-error technique used by software to obtain password information from system.</p><p>A brute force attack are normally used by hackers when there is no chance of taking advantage of encrypted system weakness or by security analysis experts to test an organization’s network security .This method of password cracking is very fast for short length passwords but for long length passwords <a class="link"   href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictionary_attack" >dictionary attack <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> technique is normally used.</p><p>Time taken by brute force password cracking software to crack password is normally depend upon speed of system and internet connection.</p><p><strong>GPU Password Cracking:</strong></p><p><a class="link"   href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit" >GPU <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is graphics processing unit, sometimes also called visual processing unit. Before talking about GPU password cracking we must have some understanding about <a class="link"   href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function" >hashes <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. When user enter password the password information stored in form of computer hashes using the one-way hashing algorithm.</p><p>In this password cracking technique using GPU software take a password guess and look through hashing algorithm and compare it or match it with the existing hashes till the exact match.</p><p>GPU can perform mathematical functions in parallel as GPU have hundreds of core that gives massive advantage in cracking password. GPU is much faster than CPU so that’s the reason of using GPU instead of CPU.</p><p><strong>CUDA Password Cracking:</strong></p><p><a class="link"   href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CUDA" >CUDA <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> Compute Unified Device Architecture is a model for programming and a platform that perform computations in parallel, created by NVIDIA for graphic processing.</p><p>CUDA Password cracking includes cracking passwords using Graphics card which have GPU chip, GPU can perform mathematical functions in parallel so the speed of cracking password is faster than CPU.GPU have many 32bit chips on it that perform this operation very quickly.</p><p>We can easily access CUDA through libraries, directives and with the help of different programming languages that includes C, C++ and FORTRAN.</p><p><strong>Password Cracking Tools</strong></p><p>Given below is the list of Top10 Password cracking tools.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1997662/19272" target="_top" id="1997662">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1997662" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1997662/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="1-Cain-and-Abel-Top-password-cracking-tool-for-Windows"><a href="#1-Cain-and-Abel-Top-password-cracking-tool-for-Windows" class="headerlink" title="1.

However, pattern locks are easy to crack, and today, we bring you all you want to know about pattern locks and how to create a <strong>hard pattern lock</strong>. Further to this, we also tell you how to move beyond pattern locks and what to do in case you forgot the hard pattern lock you just set and are unable to unlock your smartphone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/09/hard-pattern-lock-1.jpg"                      alt="creating more secure pattern locks"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-You-Need-to-Know-About-Pattern-Locks"><a href="#Part-1-What-You-Need-to-Know-About-Pattern-Locks" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What You Need to Know About Pattern Locks"></a>Part 1: What You Need to Know About Pattern Locks</h2><p>Pattern lock is an Android-only feature that makes it easy for users to have a modicum of security on their smartphones. Most users do not prefer using and remembering a PIN to unlock the smartphone. Creating a pattern makes it easier, somehow.</p><p>There is a 9-point grid on which you swipe your finger from point to point, in any direction, and when you take your finger off, that pattern you swiped becomes the key to unlock your smartphone.</p><p>Pattern locks were exceedingly common only a few years ago, and they are not recommended for use any longer due to concerns (mentioned later in the article).</p><h3 id="1-1-Popularity-and-Usage"><a href="#1-1-Popularity-and-Usage" class="headerlink" title="1.1: Popularity and Usage"></a>1.1: Popularity and Usage</h3><p>Old habits die hard, or so they say, right? That’s because it is true. We are creatures of habit, and pattern locks have been around for a long, long time. We are accustomed to pattern locks. So, even with even easier technologies such as fingerprint recognition and face recognition, we tend to gravitate towards the familiar old pattern lock.</p><p>The only thing is, there is a reason why pattern locks are no longer the preferred option to use for unlocking your smartphones. As it happens, that reason is security, and it can be very easy for humans to take a swipe (pardon the pun) at your pattern lock. And guess what? The research conducted suggests that they would get it right with an unsettling accuracy.</p><h3 id="1-2-Advantages-and-Drawbacks"><a href="#1-2-Advantages-and-Drawbacks" class="headerlink" title="1.2: Advantages and Drawbacks"></a>1.2: Advantages and Drawbacks</h3><p>With on-the-go lifestyles, our smartphones have become indispensable and contain some of the most sensitive aspects of our lives – IDs, credit and debit cards in digital wallets, photo and video memories, business documents – you name it, the smartphones have it, on the go. This has opened our lives up to the public at large, and if someone steals our smartphone or, best case, finds it, the only barrier preventing them from being privy to all that wealth of our sensitive information is that screen lock – the pattern lock that we set on our smartphones. That’s it – the single pattern lock stands between malicious actors and our data. You might be beginning to realize just how crazy this is.</p><h4 id="Advantages-of-Pattern-Locks"><a href="#Advantages-of-Pattern-Locks" class="headerlink" title="Advantages of Pattern Locks"></a>Advantages of Pattern Locks</h4><p>There are two advantages to using pattern locks. One, they are better than nothing. Two, they are easy to use. And that’s about it. There is no third advantage to pattern locks. We might think we set a hard pattern lock that nobody could guess, but, as research proves, we might be thinking too low of human prowess.</p><h4 id="Disadvantages-of-Pattern-Locks"><a href="#Disadvantages-of-Pattern-Locks" class="headerlink" title="Disadvantages of Pattern Locks"></a>Disadvantages of Pattern Locks</h4><p>Security, or rather, the lack of it, is the lone disadvantage of using a pattern lock. What good is a pattern lock that can be easily deciphered? Sure, they are easy to use, and they are better than not having anything, but would you really want to protect your life’s data with something that could be, as researchers found out, breached in under 5 attempts? We don’t think you do!</p><p>The research found that 64% of test subjects who were shown videos of people unlocking their phones could correctly guess a 6-point pattern lock, that too after viewing the video only once! That number shot up to 80% if they were allowed to see the video again. That is simply astounding and a nightmare for security. When it comes to PINs, only 11% could guess a 6-digit PIN after viewing the unlocking video once, and that number shot up to 27% when they could see the video two times.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-To-Create-a-Hard-Pattern-Lock-Including-Remembering-Complex-Patterns"><a href="#Part-2-How-To-Create-a-Hard-Pattern-Lock-Including-Remembering-Complex-Patterns" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How To Create a Hard Pattern Lock (Including Remembering Complex Patterns)"></a>Part 2: How To Create a Hard Pattern Lock (Including Remembering Complex Patterns)</h2><p>Now, if you must continue using a pattern lock, let’s help you know how to create a hard pattern lock that would not be as easy to decipher as easy pattern locks. For that, you should know how people use pattern locks, the kind of pattern locks they create, and the ones that are the most commonly used pattern locks. That way, you can avoid those fallacies and create a hard pattern lock for your smartphone.</p><h3 id="2-1-The-Pattern-Locks-People-Use-Most-Commonly"><a href="#2-1-The-Pattern-Locks-People-Use-Most-Commonly" class="headerlink" title="2.1: The Pattern Locks People Use Most Commonly"></a>2.1: The Pattern Locks People Use Most Commonly</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/09/hard-pattern-lock-2.jpg"                      alt="common pattern locks"                ></p><p>Marte Loge, an M.Sc. Computer Science student, gave a presentation on pattern locks at DEFCON 23 and made a bold claim. She said, “Tell me who you are, and I will tell you your lock pattern.”</p><p>She presented the following statistics to support her claim:</p><ul><li>- In her research, she found that 77% of people started with one of the 4 corners when creating a pattern lock.</li><li>- 44% of people started with the top-left dot and 15% with the top-right, while the bottom-left was preferred by 14% of her test subjects.</li><li>- People set 5-point pattern locks on average, and most users were content with a 4-point pattern.</li></ul><p>These are some of the most common pattern locks people create:</p><ul><li>- patterns in the shapes of alphabets,</li><li>- patterns in the shapes of numerals,</li><li>- patterns in any other simple shape, such as square, triangle, star, etc.</li></ul><p>To understand how this is a security nightmare, the possible combinations for a 4-point pattern are a measly 1624, whereas by adding just 1 more point to the pattern and creating a 5-point pattern, the number of possible combinations becomes 7152, an increase of 5528 combinations. In stark contrast, creating a 9-point pattern would give you over 140,000 possible combinations!</p><h3 id="2-2-How-to-Create-a-Hard-Pattern-Lock"><a href="#2-2-How-to-Create-a-Hard-Pattern-Lock" class="headerlink" title="2.2: How to Create a Hard Pattern Lock"></a>2.2: How to Create a Hard Pattern Lock</h3><p>Knowing what most people do when creating a pattern lock, it becomes easy to avoid those mistakes and instead create a hard pattern lock for oneself.</p><ul><li>- Do not start creating a pattern lock from any of the 4 corners of the grid.</li><li>- Never use your first initial as your pattern lock.</li><li>- Never use the shape of a numeral as your pattern lock.</li><li>- Use all 9 points on the grid to create your pattern lock, and contrary to popular belief, you can go over the connecting lines several times, creating a hard pattern lock that would not be as easy for people to decipher!</li></ul><h2 id="Part-3-Going-Beyond-Pattern-Locks"><a href="#Part-3-Going-Beyond-Pattern-Locks" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Going Beyond Pattern Locks"></a>Part 3: Going Beyond Pattern Locks</h2><p>You might think that now that you have set a hard pattern lock, you are good to go.

Using fingerprint recognition requires you to set a 6-digit PIN and then set a fingerprint to unlock your device. You can set additional fingerprints, too.</p><p>This way, your device is the most secure it can be today. In case your fingerprint is not recognized for any reason, the phone falls back on the 6-digit PIN that you can enter and unlock your phone.</p><p>While face recognition is available on both Android and Apple devices, it is truly secure only on Apple devices. This is why Apple iPhones released after the iPhone X in 2017 have come only with Face ID. They fall back on a minimum 6-digit PIN (called Passcode in Apple world) to unlock in case the face does not get recognized in the first attempt.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2130875/7443" target="_top" id="2130875">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2130875" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2130875/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-4-How-To-Unlock-Phone-If-Hard-Pattern-Lock-Forgotten"><a href="#Part-4-How-To-Unlock-Phone-If-Hard-Pattern-Lock-Forgotten" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How To Unlock Phone If Hard Pattern Lock Forgotten"></a>Part 4: How To Unlock Phone If Hard Pattern Lock Forgotten</h2><p>Just in case you set a hard pattern lock and promptly forgot that abstruse pattern you just set, we have a tool for you to quickly unlock your phone in case of a forgotten hard pattern lock: Wondershare Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://drfone.wondershare.com/style/images/arrow_up.png"                      alt="arrow"                ></p><h3 id="Dr-Fone-Screen-Unlock-Android"><a href="#Dr-Fone-Screen-Unlock-Android" class="headerlink" title="Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (Android)"></a><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare-dr-fone-unlock-android-screen/" >Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (Android) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>Remove the Hard Pattern Lock on Your Gionee F3 Pro If You Forgot!</p><ul><li>Remove all Android screen locks (PIN&#x2F;pattern&#x2F;fingerprints&#x2F;face ID) in minutes.</li><li>Bypass the FRP lock of Samsung without a PIN or Google account.</li><li>Everyone can handle the lock screen without any tech knowledge.</li><li>Provide specific removal solutions to promise good success rate.</li></ul><p><strong>4,008,671</strong> people have downloaded it</p><p>Download the latest version of Dr.Fone from the Wondershare website and launch the app.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png"                      alt="drfone app"                ></p><p>Step 1: Click Android under Toolbox &gt; Screen Unlock.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/select-your-mobile-device-to-unlock.png"                      alt="drfone android screen unlock"                ></p><p>Step 2: Click Unlock Android Screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/android-screen-unlock-3.png"                      alt="drfone screen unlock android"                ></p><p>Step 3: Select your device manufacturer.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/screen-unlock-any-android-device-2.png"                      alt="drfone screen unlock manufacturer selection"                ></p><p>Step 4: Prepare your device to unlock the screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/unlock-android-screen-google.png"                      alt="wipe partition cache instructions"                ></p><p>When the greyed Next button becomes available, click it and wait for your device to be unlocked.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/screen-unlock-any-android-device-6.png"                      alt="screen unlock successful"                ></p><p>All data on the Gionee F3 Pro device is wiped under this method.

However, one should know that if they consider deleting their Gmail account, they won’t be able to send or receive emails. With that, let’s proceed to reveal all essential methods that can be used to <strong>delete a Gmail account permanently</strong>. This article will also focus on a perfect tool that assists in making the process easier.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/delete-gmail-account-with-without-password-1.jpg"                      alt="deleting gmail account permanently"                ></p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Part-1-Synopsis-Things-To-Know-Before-Deleting-Gmail-Account"><a href="#Part-1-Synopsis-Things-To-Know-Before-Deleting-Gmail-Account" class="headerlink" title="Part 1.

For that, this part is putting up a discussion on the important things that a user should know before they <strong>delete their Gmail account permanently:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>No Going Back:</strong> If you delete a Gmail account, the process is irreversible. All details and information will be lost, and the email won’t be trackable ever again.</li><li><strong>Cannot Reset Passwords if Connected:</strong> If the Gmail account is connected to any other service, make sure that you remember their passwords. Since the account will be deleted, you cannot reset their passwords.</li><li><strong>Access to Other Services:</strong> Although you are deleting your Gmail account, you can still access Google Photos, Google Drive, and other services.</li><li><strong>Lookout For Emails:</strong> Ensure that the emails in your account are saved.

Do this several times in a row.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Double-tap the string of symbols to highlight them, then copy the string. Now, tap on the screen to paste the copied string. Repeat this process 10 to 11 times until you can no longer highlight the series.</li><li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Go back to the lock screen. Open the <strong>Camera</strong> app by tapping the camera icon or sliding left. Simultaneously, pull down the Notification Panel from the top.</li><li><strong>Step 5:</strong> In the Notification Panel, tap the gear icon to try and access your device’s settings.</li><li><strong>Step 6:</strong> When prompted for a password, long-press and paste the copied string into the password field. Repeat this several times until the option to paste is no longer available.</li><li><strong>Step 7:</strong> Keep pasting the string until the interface crashes. The lock screen should disappear, and the camera interface will expand. After some time, the camera app should also crash, and your device will unlock, displaying the home screen.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/unlock-emergency-call-phone-04.jpg"                      alt="android home screen"                ></p><p>This method, while unconventional, has been known to work on various Android 5 devices, including Samsung models.

But at this moment, at least you have known a perfect way that you can remove screen lock without losing data on your Android phone.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins><br><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://snapchat-videos.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-from-novice-to-pro-creating-snapchat-boomers/"><u>[New] In 2024, From Novice to Pro Creating Snapchat Boomers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-video-capture.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-aggregating-the-top-5-mac-clipping-applications/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Aggregating the Top 5 Mac Clipping Applications</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-footage.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-deciphering-youtubes-subscriber-code/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Deciphering YouTube's Subscriber Code</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-support.techidaily.com/updated-specialized-compilation-choosing-ringtones-with-ease/"><u>[Updated] Specialized Compilation Choosing Ringtones with Ease</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-unlock.techidaily.com/10-easy-to-use-frp-bypass-tools-for-unlocking-google-accounts-on-motorola-razr-40-by-drfone-android/"><u>10 Easy-to-Use FRP Bypass Tools for Unlocking Google Accounts On Motorola Razr 40</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-video-capture.techidaily.com/2024-approved-top-5-online-video-capture-tools/"><u>2024 Approved Top 5 Online Video Capture Tools</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-unlock.techidaily.com/how-to-easily-unlock-asus-screen-by-drfone-android/"><u>How To Easily Unlock Asus Screen?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-lock-your-vivo-t2x-5g-phone-in-style-the-top-5-gesture-lock-screen-apps-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, Lock Your Vivo T2x 5G Phone in Style The Top 5 Gesture Lock Screen Apps</u></a></li><li><a href="https://hardware-updates.techidaily.com/step-by-step-guide-to-downloading-logitech-g27-racing-wheel-drivers-for-windows-operating-systems-11-1/"><u>Step-by-Step Guide to Downloading Logitech G27 Racing Wheel Drivers for Windows Operating Systems (11, 1</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win11-tips.techidaily.com/troubleshooting-character-maps-unresponsiveness-in-windows-os/"><u>Troubleshooting Character Maps Unresponsiveness in Windows OS</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-unlock.techidaily.com/unlocking-made-easy-the-best-10-apps-for-unlocking-your-vivo-s17-device-by-drfone-android/"><u>Unlocking Made Easy The Best 10 Apps for Unlocking Your Vivo S17 Device</u></a></li><li><a href="https://howto.techidaily.com/what-to-do-if-google-play-services-keeps-stopping-on-vivo-x100-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>What to Do if Google Play Services Keeps Stopping on Vivo X100 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://techidaily.com/your-complete-guide-to-reset-honor-magic-v2-drfone-by-drfone-reset-android-reset-android/"><u>Your Complete Guide To Reset Honor Magic V2 | Dr.fone</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

Nothing could be more frustrating than gazing at your phone, knowing that it is essentially a paperweight at this point. Unless you can get it unlocked, your phone is useless, and all of your important photos, text messages, and content are all locked out of your reach. While right now, nothing can do without a Google account. But you can try to reset your Google account first.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Bypass-Lock-Screen-on-Android-device-with-Google-Account-Android-Device-Manager"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Bypass-Lock-Screen-on-Android-device-with-Google-Account-Android-Device-Manager" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to Bypass Lock Screen on Android device with Google Account (Android Device Manager)"></a>Part 1: How to Bypass Lock Screen on Android device with Google Account (Android Device Manager)</h2><p>Even if you have a Google account, if your phone isn’t connected to the internet, you cannot access it to unlock your phone. If this sounds familiar, you can always try this method.</p><p>1. First, navigate to the Android Device Manager page. You will need to sign in with the Google account that you use to set up your phone.</p><p>Android Device Manager link: <a class="link"   href="http://www.google.com/android/devicemanager" >http://www.google.com/android/devicemanager <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14637942446007.jpg"                      alt="android Device Manager log in"                ></p><p>2. Once you have logged in, you will automatically be redirected to the Android Device Manager page. If this is your first time, click the “Accept” button.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14637942473262.jpg"                      alt="android Device Manager start"                ></p><p>3. A list of all of the Huawei Nova Y71 devices registered to this Android account will pop up. Select the Huawei Nova Y71 device in question from this list.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14637942503282.jpg"                      alt="android Device Manager list of devices"                ></p><p>4. The Android Device Manager will then locate your device. Make sure it is turned on!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14637942532352.jpg"                      alt="android Device Manager locating device"                ></p><p>5. After it has been located, you will have a few options for what to do next. If you do not know your phone’s location, you can call it from this screen, but if you know where it is, click the ‘Enable Lock &amp; Erase’ option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14637942568385.jpg"                      alt="android Device Manager device located"                ></p><p>6. A notification will pop up on your device; confirm it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14637942582896.jpg"                      alt="android Device Manager Erase &amp; Lock"                ></p><p>7. At this point, you will be asked to create a new lock screen password. Once you have chosen one, press “Lock.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14637943377629.jpg"                      alt="android Device Manager New Lock Screen"                ></p><p>8. Now, simply enter the new passcode on your device, and voila! It will open, and you can get back to your daily routine.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Reset-Your-Google-Account-on-your-Android-Phone"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Reset-Your-Google-Account-on-your-Android-Phone" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Reset Your Google Account on your Android Phone"></a>Part 2: How to Reset Your Google Account on your Android Phone</h2><p>If you have forgotten your Google Account password, it is still possible to unlock your account and access the information within. Here is how you can unlock your Google account on your Android phone.</p><p>1. On your browser, go to the Google home page and try to sign in. You will fail, but that is good! It will lead you to the next step.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14637535742329.jpg"                      alt="android Google web page"                ></p><p>2. Since you cannot sign in on the sign-in page, you can now select the ‘Help’ link.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14637535763672.jpg"                      alt="android Goodle log in"                ></p><p>3. Choose the “forgot password” option. You will be prompted to enter your email address to proceed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14637535788151.jpg"                      alt="android Google trouble signing in"                ></p><p>4. Two options will then appear: the first is your phone number, and the other asks you for your backup email.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14637535828239.jpg"                      alt="android Google forgot password"                ><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14637535857339.jpg"                      alt="android Google forgot pssword enter email"                ></p><p>5. Enter either one of these options, and you will receive a verification code via email, SMS, or a telephone call from an operator. If you have chosen to enter your backup email, at this point, you will receive detailed instructions on how to access the ‘reset password’ page.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14637561923476.jpg"                      alt="android Google automated call verification"                ><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14637561995841.jpg"                      alt="android Google automated call verification"                ></p><p>6.

Here’s How You Can Unlock Sony Xperia 1 V Pattern Lock Screen</h2><p>Forgetting the pattern lock of a device and getting locked out of it is probably one of the most frustrating scenarios faced by Android users. Nevertheless, unlike popular operating systems, Android provides a seamless way to past the forgot pattern lock feature.</p><p>You can either try Google’s native solution or a third-party tool in case you have forgotten the pattern lock on your device and reset it. In no time, you will be able to access your device (or even someone else’s phone by following these techniques). To make things easier for you, we have provided three simple solutions to resolve forgotten patterns on Android devices.</p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/68FqgS6Ym8E" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-bypass-forgot-pattern-lock-using-the-‘Forgot-Pattern’-feature"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-bypass-forgot-pattern-lock-using-the-‘Forgot-Pattern’-feature" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to bypass forgot pattern lock using the ‘Forgot Pattern’ feature?"></a>Part 1: How to bypass forgot pattern lock using the ‘Forgot Pattern’ feature?</h2><p>One of the easiest and fastest ways to fix the forgot pattern lock issue on a device is by using its inbuilt “Forgot Pattern” feature. If you are using an Android 4.4 or earlier version, then you can simply access this feature. Since users can hack an Android device just by knowing the Google credentials of the connected device, the solution was later discontinued (as it was considered a security vulnerability). Nevertheless, if your device hasn’t been updated and you are using an Android 4.4 or previous version, then you can bypass the forgot pattern lock by following these steps:</p><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Firstly, provide the wrong pattern to your device. It will let you know that you applied the incorrect pattern.</p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> On the same prompt, you can see an option of “Forgot pattern” on the bottom. Simply tap on it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/09/15059289368742.jpg"                      alt="forgot pattern"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3.</strong> This will open a new screen, which can be used to bypass the forgotten pattern of Android. Select the option for entering the Google Account details and proceed.</p><p><strong>Step 4.</strong> To reset the forgot pattern lock, you need to provide the correct Google credentials of the account already linked to the Sony Xperia 1 V device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/09/15059290192675.jpg"                      alt="enter google account"                ></p><p><strong>Step 5.</strong> After signing in to the interface, you will be asked to provide a new pattern lock for the Sony Xperia 1 V device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/09/15059290477717.jpg"                      alt="draw an unlock pattern"                ></p><p><strong>Step 6.</strong> Confirm your choice and set a new pattern lock on your device.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-get-past-forgot-pattern-lock-using-Dr-Fone-Screen-Unlock-Android"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-get-past-forgot-pattern-lock-using-Dr-Fone-Screen-Unlock-Android" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to get past forgot pattern lock using Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (Android)?"></a>Part 2: How to get past forgot pattern lock using Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (Android)?</h2><p>One of the major drawbacks of the “Forgot pattern” feature is that it doesn’t work on new Android devices.

Common Problems When Using Google Assistant</h2><p>Unable to use <strong>Google Assistant to unlock phone</strong> is not the only drawback that users may have encountered in recent changes. Although Google Assistant on the lock screen presents a revolutionary way to interact with your phone, like any technology, it also comes with its share of challenges. Some of the common problems when using Google Assistant are:</p><ol><li><strong>Misunderstandings and misinterpretations</strong></li></ol><p>One prevalent issue users encounter is Google Assistant misunderstanding or misinterpreting voice commands. This can be influenced by factors such as background noise, accent variations, or pronunciation differences.</p><ol start="2"><li><strong>Limited context understanding</strong></li></ol><p>While Google Assistant is adept at understanding individual commands, it may struggle with complex, multi-step requests that rely heavily on context. Break down your tasks into simpler commands to enhance comprehension and execute it more accurately.</p><ol start="3"><li><strong>Inability to execute certain tasks</strong></li></ol><p>Google Assistant’s capabilities are extensive, but there are instances where it may struggle to execute specific tasks. For example, it can’t execute tasks that involve interacting with certain third-party applications or services. You can’t also <strong>unlock phone with voice Google Assistant.</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/unlock-phone-with-voice-google-assistant-4.jpg"                      alt="Giving command to Google Asisstant on lock screen"                ></p><h3 id="Tips-to-Make-Voice-Google-Assistant-Recognize-Your-Commands"><a href="#Tips-to-Make-Voice-Google-Assistant-Recognize-Your-Commands" class="headerlink" title="Tips to Make Voice Google Assistant Recognize Your Commands"></a>Tips to Make Voice Google Assistant Recognize Your Commands</h3><p>One of the most infuriating problems with voice Google Assistant is that users often encounter difficulties in having their commands accurately recognized. To enhance the accuracy of voice recognition with Google Assistant, you can consider implementing the following tips:</p><ol><li><strong>Speak Clearly and Naturally</strong></li></ol><p>Make sure that you speak in a clear and natural manner. Avoid mumbling or speaking too quickly. Enunciate your words, giving Google Assistant a better chance to interpret your commands accurately.</p><ol start="2"><li><strong>Use Simple and Direct Phrases</strong></li></ol><p>Keep your commands simple and direct. Avoid unnecessary elaboration or complex sentence structures. Google Assistant is more likely to understand straightforward commands.</p><ol start="3"><li><strong>Check Your Microphone</strong></li></ol><p>Ensure that your device’s microphone is in good working condition. Dirt or debris on your phone’s microphone can affect its performance. Clean the microphone area and try again.</p><ol start="4"><li><strong>Quiet Environment</strong></li></ol><p>Background noise can interfere with voice recognition.

It allows you to unlock your phone bootloader. A bootloader or bootstrap loader gathers the operating system files, loads them into memory, and hands over control, essentially starting your device. Unlocking the bootloader assists you in installing custom ROMs, flashing custom kernels, and rooting your phone.</p><p>However, this freedom comes with some trade-offs. Most manufacturers will void your warranty if you unlock the bootloader, and it can also make your phone face higher risks of malware and other security threats. Additionally, it can be difficult to relock the bootloader once you unlock it.</p><p>If you encounter the <strong>OEM unlock missing</strong> on your Android phone despite wanting to unlock your bootloader, this article can help. You will learn the step-by-step guide for the different methods to fix the <strong>missing OEM unlock</strong> option. Before diving into solutions, let’s explore why this option might be unavailable in the first place.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/oem-unlock-missing-01.jpg"                      alt="using a phone at work"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-Why-Is-OEM-Unlock-Missing-on-Your-Device"><a href="#Part-1-Why-Is-OEM-Unlock-Missing-on-Your-Device" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Why Is OEM Unlock Missing on Your Device?"></a>Part 1: Why Is OEM Unlock Missing on Your Device?</h2><p>Finding that OEM Unlock is missing on your Android phones can be frustrating, particularly if you plan to modify your software or install a custom ROM. But don’t worry. There are several possible explanations for this. Let’s explore some of the most common reasons:</p><p>Manufacturer Restrictions</p><p>The <strong>Missing OEM Unlock</strong> option can often be due to restrictions imposed by your device’s manufacturers. They may intentionally remove this option to safeguard device security and compatibility. It is common with carrier-locked devices. As a result, the OEM Unlock option may not show.</p><p>Bootloader Already Unlocked</p><p>In some cases, the <strong>Android OEM Unlock Missing</strong> issue arises <a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/how-to-unlock-xiaomi-bootloader.html"><u>when the bootloader has already been unlocked</u></a>. Relocking the bootloader might make the option reappear. But exercise caution as this process can erase device data.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/oem-unlock-missing-02.jpg"                      alt="oem unlock option greyed out"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://imp.i357552.net/c/5597632/1001453/11832" target="_top" id="1001453">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/11832-1001453" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.i357552.net/i/5597632/1001453/11832"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Developer Options Not Enabled</p><p>It might seem obvious, but sometimes the simplest things get overlooked. The OEM Unlock option can only be accessed from within Developer Options. If this menu isn’t enabled, you won’t see it.</p><p>Carrier-Locked Devices</p><p>The <strong>OEM Unlock Missing</strong> issue can also occur if your device is <a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/sim-unlock/carrier-unlock-android-phone.html"><u>carrier-locked</u></a>. Carriers often impose restrictions to prevent users from switching networks, and bootloader unlocking is one way to do that. Unfortunately, the <strong>missing OEM Unlock</strong> option is usually intentional, and unlocking your device can be more complicated.</p><p>Security Features</p><p>Enhanced security features, like Samsung’s KNOX, can sometimes conceal the OEM Unlock option. Temporarily turning off these features might show the option, but it’s crucial to be aware of the potential security implications of doing so.</p><p>Corrupted Bootloader</p><p>A corrupted bootloader can also lead to the <strong>Android OEM Unlock missing</strong> problem. The bootloader plays a role in the boot process, and if it’s damaged, it might not display the necessary options. This can be caused by software glitches, failed flashing attempts, or even <a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/device-diagnostics/how-to-run-a-hardware-test-on-xiaomi.html"><u>hardware issues</u></a>. In this scenario, you might need to consult your device’s manufacturer or a technical specialist to help repair or re-flash the bootloader.</p><p>Connectivity Issues</p><p>A poor connection between your device and computer can also prevent the OEM Unlocking from showing up. Check your cables and try using different USB ports to ensure a stable connection.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-To-Enable-Missing-OEM-Unlock-Without-a-Password"><a href="#Part-2-How-To-Enable-Missing-OEM-Unlock-Without-a-Password" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How To Enable Missing OEM Unlock Without a Password?"></a>Part 2: How To Enable Missing OEM Unlock Without a Password?</h2><p>Unlocking your phone’s bootloader (OEM Unlock) varies across models and brands.

In the Screen Security choice, the None bar can not be chosen.</strong></p><p>Description of the problem: There is a sentence below it stated: “Disabled by administrators, encryption policy or credential storage”. All the space of the None option is in white and grey.</p><p>The solution to this problem is quite simple. Once you have made sure you are suffering from this nasty one, try to follow these below pieces of advice to see if it is capable of giving you a hand.</p><p>Step 1: Open the Settings menu from the main screen. Then tap on the Credential Storage. You will see a drop-down menu like the screenshot below.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14556834486843.jpg"                      alt="disable lock screen android"                ></p><p>Step 2: Continue to tap on the Clear Credentials (Remove all certificates) option. Then next click on the OK button. Wait for some seconds until your Android device has finished the process.</p><p>Step 3: To make sure that the previous step has been performed successfully, try looking at the bottom of the drop-down menu. If the Clear Credentials (Remove all certificates) are grey out and can not be selected, then you have managed to do it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14556833184389.jpg"                      alt="disable lock screen android"                ></p><p>Step 4: Now that the problem is solved, you can feel free to turn back to your Screen lock option in the beginning and disable the feature of locking screen Android as usual.</p><p>2.
