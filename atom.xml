However, pattern locks are easy to crack, and today, we bring you all you want to know about pattern locks and how to create a <strong>hard pattern lock</strong>. Further to this, we also tell you how to move beyond pattern locks and what to do in case you forgot the hard pattern lock you just set and are unable to unlock your smartphone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/09/hard-pattern-lock-1.jpg"                      alt="creating more secure pattern locks"                ></p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Part-1-What-You-Need-to-Know-About-Pattern-Locks"><a href="#Part-1-What-You-Need-to-Know-About-Pattern-Locks" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What You Need to Know About Pattern Locks"></a>Part 1: What You Need to Know About Pattern Locks</h2><p>Pattern lock is an Android-only feature that makes it easy for users to have a modicum of security on their smartphones. Most users do not prefer using and remembering a PIN to unlock the smartphone. Creating a pattern makes it easier, somehow.</p><p>There is a 9-point grid on which you swipe your finger from point to point, in any direction, and when you take your finger off, that pattern you swiped becomes the key to unlock your smartphone.</p><p>Pattern locks were exceedingly common only a few years ago, and they are not recommended for use any longer due to concerns (mentioned later in the article).</p><h3 id="1-1-Popularity-and-Usage"><a href="#1-1-Popularity-and-Usage" class="headerlink" title="1.1: Popularity and Usage"></a>1.1: Popularity and Usage</h3><p>Old habits die hard, or so they say, right? That’s because it is true. We are creatures of habit, and pattern locks have been around for a long, long time. We are accustomed to pattern locks. So, even with even easier technologies such as fingerprint recognition and face recognition, we tend to gravitate towards the familiar old pattern lock.</p><p>The only thing is, there is a reason why pattern locks are no longer the preferred option to use for unlocking your smartphones. As it happens, that reason is security, and it can be very easy for humans to take a swipe (pardon the pun) at your pattern lock. And guess what? The research conducted suggests that they would get it right with an unsettling accuracy.</p><h3 id="1-2-Advantages-and-Drawbacks"><a href="#1-2-Advantages-and-Drawbacks" class="headerlink" title="1.2: Advantages and Drawbacks"></a>1.2: Advantages and Drawbacks</h3><p>With on-the-go lifestyles, our smartphones have become indispensable and contain some of the most sensitive aspects of our lives – IDs, credit and debit cards in digital wallets, photo and video memories, business documents – you name it, the smartphones have it, on the go. This has opened our lives up to the public at large, and if someone steals our smartphone or, best case, finds it, the only barrier preventing them from being privy to all that wealth of our sensitive information is that screen lock – the pattern lock that we set on our smartphones. That’s it – the single pattern lock stands between malicious actors and our data. You might be beginning to realize just how crazy this is.</p><h4 id="Advantages-of-Pattern-Locks"><a href="#Advantages-of-Pattern-Locks" class="headerlink" title="Advantages of Pattern Locks"></a>Advantages of Pattern Locks</h4><p>There are two advantages to using pattern locks. One, they are better than nothing. Two, they are easy to use. And that’s about it. There is no third advantage to pattern locks. We might think we set a hard pattern lock that nobody could guess, but, as research proves, we might be thinking too low of human prowess.</p><h4 id="Disadvantages-of-Pattern-Locks"><a href="#Disadvantages-of-Pattern-Locks" class="headerlink" title="Disadvantages of Pattern Locks"></a>Disadvantages of Pattern Locks</h4><p>Security, or rather, the lack of it, is the lone disadvantage of using a pattern lock. What good is a pattern lock that can be easily deciphered? Sure, they are easy to use, and they are better than not having anything, but would you really want to protect your life’s data with something that could be, as researchers found out, breached in under 5 attempts? We don’t think you do!</p><p>The research found that 64% of test subjects who were shown videos of people unlocking their phones could correctly guess a 6-point pattern lock, that too after viewing the video only once! That number shot up to 80% if they were allowed to see the video again. That is simply astounding and a nightmare for security. When it comes to PINs, only 11% could guess a 6-digit PIN after viewing the unlocking video once, and that number shot up to 27% when they could see the video two times.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-To-Create-a-Hard-Pattern-Lock-Including-Remembering-Complex-Patterns"><a href="#Part-2-How-To-Create-a-Hard-Pattern-Lock-Including-Remembering-Complex-Patterns" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How To Create a Hard Pattern Lock (Including Remembering Complex Patterns)"></a>Part 2: How To Create a Hard Pattern Lock (Including Remembering Complex Patterns)</h2><p>Now, if you must continue using a pattern lock, let’s help you know how to create a hard pattern lock that would not be as easy to decipher as easy pattern locks. For that, you should know how people use pattern locks, the kind of pattern locks they create, and the ones that are the most commonly used pattern locks. That way, you can avoid those fallacies and create a hard pattern lock for your smartphone.</p><h3 id="2-1-The-Pattern-Locks-People-Use-Most-Commonly"><a href="#2-1-The-Pattern-Locks-People-Use-Most-Commonly" class="headerlink" title="2.1: The Pattern Locks People Use Most Commonly"></a>2.1: The Pattern Locks People Use Most Commonly</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/09/hard-pattern-lock-2.jpg"                      alt="common pattern locks"                ></p><p>Marte Loge, an M.Sc. Computer Science student, gave a presentation on pattern locks at DEFCON 23 and made a bold claim. She said, “Tell me who you are, and I will tell you your lock pattern.”</p><p>She presented the following statistics to support her claim:</p><ul><li>- In her research, she found that 77% of people started with one of the 4 corners when creating a pattern lock.</li><li>- 44% of people started with the top-left dot and 15% with the top-right, while the bottom-left was preferred by 14% of her test subjects.</li><li>- People set 5-point pattern locks on average, and most users were content with a 4-point pattern.</li></ul><p>These are some of the most common pattern locks people create:</p><ul><li>- patterns in the shapes of alphabets,</li><li>- patterns in the shapes of numerals,</li><li>- patterns in any other simple shape, such as square, triangle, star, etc.</li></ul><p>To understand how this is a security nightmare, the possible combinations for a 4-point pattern are a measly 1624, whereas by adding just 1 more point to the pattern and creating a 5-point pattern, the number of possible combinations becomes 7152, an increase of 5528 combinations. In stark contrast, creating a 9-point pattern would give you over 140,000 possible combinations!</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://bluetties.sjv.io/c/5597632/2141688/17094" target="_top" id="2141688">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17094-2141688" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="120" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://bluetties.sjv.io/i/5597632/2141688/17094"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="2-2-How-to-Create-a-Hard-Pattern-Lock"><a href="#2-2-How-to-Create-a-Hard-Pattern-Lock" class="headerlink" title="2.2: How to Create a Hard Pattern Lock"></a>2.2: How to Create a Hard Pattern Lock</h3><p>Knowing what most people do when creating a pattern lock, it becomes easy to avoid those mistakes and instead create a hard pattern lock for oneself.</p><ul><li>- Do not start creating a pattern lock from any of the 4 corners of the grid.</li><li>- Never use your first initial as your pattern lock.</li><li>- Never use the shape of a numeral as your pattern lock.</li><li>- Use all 9 points on the grid to create your pattern lock, and contrary to popular belief, you can go over the connecting lines several times, creating a hard pattern lock that would not be as easy for people to decipher!</li></ul><h2 id="Part-3-Going-Beyond-Pattern-Locks"><a href="#Part-3-Going-Beyond-Pattern-Locks" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Going Beyond Pattern Locks"></a>Part 3: Going Beyond Pattern Locks</h2><p>You might think that now that you have set a hard pattern lock, you are good to go. Hardly. Technology has evolved, so have methods to break into your device.</p><h4 id="Step-1-Set-a-6-digit-PIN"><a href="#Step-1-Set-a-6-digit-PIN" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Set a 6-digit PIN"></a>Step 1: Set a 6-digit PIN</h4><p>The minimum you should do today is set a 6-digit PIN to unlock your phone. Consider this a necessary investment into the safety of your data residing on your smartphone.</p><h4 id="Step-2-Use-Fingerprint-Recognition-or-Face-Recognition-on-Apple-Devices"><a href="#Step-2-Use-Fingerprint-Recognition-or-Face-Recognition-on-Apple-Devices" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Use Fingerprint Recognition (or Face Recognition on Apple Devices)"></a>Step 2: Use Fingerprint Recognition (or Face Recognition on Apple Devices)</h4><p>All modern smartphones released over the last decade have come with fingerprint recognition. Using fingerprint recognition requires you to set a 6-digit PIN and then set a fingerprint to unlock your device. You can set additional fingerprints, too.</p><p>This way, your device is the most secure it can be today. In case your fingerprint is not recognized for any reason, the phone falls back on the 6-digit PIN that you can enter and unlock your phone.</p><p>While face recognition is available on both Android and Apple devices, it is truly secure only on Apple devices. This is why Apple iPhones released after the iPhone X in 2017 have come only with Face ID. They fall back on a minimum 6-digit PIN (called Passcode in Apple world) to unlock in case the face does not get recognized in the first attempt.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2043596/7443" target="_top" id="2043596">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2043596" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2043596/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-4-How-To-Unlock-Phone-If-Hard-Pattern-Lock-Forgotten"><a href="#Part-4-How-To-Unlock-Phone-If-Hard-Pattern-Lock-Forgotten" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How To Unlock Phone If Hard Pattern Lock Forgotten"></a>Part 4: How To Unlock Phone If Hard Pattern Lock Forgotten</h2><p>Just in case you set a hard pattern lock and promptly forgot that abstruse pattern you just set, we have a tool for you to quickly unlock your phone in case of a forgotten hard pattern lock: Wondershare Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://drfone.wondershare.com/style/images/arrow_up.png"                      alt="arrow"                ></p><h3 id="Dr-Fone-Screen-Unlock-Android"><a href="#Dr-Fone-Screen-Unlock-Android" class="headerlink" title="Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (Android)"></a><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare-dr-fone-unlock-android-screen/" >Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (Android) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>Remove the Hard Pattern Lock on Your Lava Blaze Curve 5G If You Forgot!</p><ul><li>Remove all Android screen locks (PIN&#x2F;pattern&#x2F;fingerprints&#x2F;face ID) in minutes.</li><li>Bypass the FRP lock of Samsung without a PIN or Google account.</li><li>Everyone can handle the lock screen without any tech knowledge.</li><li>Provide specific removal solutions to promise good success rate.</li></ul><p><strong>4,008,671</strong> people have downloaded it</p><p>Download the latest version of Dr.Fone from the Wondershare website and launch the app.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png"                      alt="drfone app"                ></p><p>Step 1: Click Android under Toolbox &gt; Screen Unlock.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/select-your-mobile-device-to-unlock.png"                      alt="drfone android screen unlock"                ></p><p>Step 2: Click Unlock Android Screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/android-screen-unlock-3.png"                      alt="drfone screen unlock android"                ></p><p>Step 3: Select your device manufacturer.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/screen-unlock-any-android-device-2.png"                      alt="drfone screen unlock manufacturer selection"                ></p><p>Step 4: Prepare your device to unlock the screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/unlock-android-screen-google.png"                      alt="wipe partition cache instructions"                ></p><p>When the greyed Next button becomes available, click it and wait for your device to be unlocked.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/screen-unlock-any-android-device-6.png"                      alt="screen unlock successful"                ></p><p>All data on the Lava Blaze Curve 5G device is wiped under this method.

To reach the lock screen settings android, you’ve to follow the path:</p><p>Options – Security – Screen Lock – Choose Screen Lock.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/android-lock-screen-settings-1.jpg"                      alt="android lock screen settings"                ></p><p>Now see how to unlock your lock screen in different ways.</p><h3 id="1-Slide"><a href="#1-Slide" class="headerlink" title="1.Slide"></a>1.Slide</h3><p>This is the most common method of unlocking an android lock screen. On all most all the android device, you’ll notice a lock mostly on the right side (sometimes on top) of a round charm. You just have to direct towards the lock and then the lock screen will be unlocked in no time. This method doesn’t provide any security (it just protects your device from sudden access by tapping on screen or any of the button) to your device as no password or PIN is required to set the “Slide” unlock.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/android-lock-screen-settings-3.jpg"                      alt="android lock screen settings"                ></p><p>Keep your any finger on the middle of the round charm and by keeping your finger pressed, reach on the lock icon. The lock screen will be unlocked just after reaching your finger to the lock icon.</p><h3 id="2-Face-Unlock"><a href="#2-Face-Unlock" class="headerlink" title="2.Face Unlock"></a>2.Face Unlock</h3><p>This method of unlocking your lock screen needs your Android device to snap a photo of your with its camera. After you set the snapped photo as the unlocking recognition, you could unlock your device through showing your face on the screen.</p><p>Capture a picture of your face with your Android device’s camera and then set it for logging in into your device. From the lock screen, by just by holding your face, you can log in. It’s very interesting, but you should never rely on this method for strong security as this method of unlocking is prone to break easily as an intruder can unlock your device by putting a photo of you in front of your device. Moreover, this method sometimes doesn’t work properly. So it’s better to go for some other highly secured options for locking your screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/android-lock-screen-settings-4.jpg"                      alt="android lock screen settings"                ></p><h3 id="3-Pattern"><a href="#3-Pattern" class="headerlink" title="3.Pattern"></a>3.Pattern</h3><p>This is a way of setting pattern for lock screen from a grid of nine dots. You can select the pattern like some letter like Z, L or C etc, but nothing guarantees high security as the set pattern can be easily guessed or be seen while you are unlocking your device. Another problem is that by unlocking with the same pattern, your finger leaves some marks for the pattern’s path. By following the path, a stranger can unlock your device. So for little security, you can use pattern unlock method on your Android device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/android-lock-screen-settings-5.jpg"                      alt="android lock screen settings"                ></p><p>Go to the lock screen setting for Pattern and then set the pattern by sliding your finger from one dot to another, then another and like that way. Remember which pattern you’ve set in order to unlock your device in the next time.</p><h3 id="4-PIN"><a href="#4-PIN" class="headerlink" title="4.PIN"></a>4.PIN</h3><p>You might be troubled by thinking about the difference between PIN and Password. A little distinction is there for a PIN and that is it consists of numbers only whereas for password, you can associate some alphabetical letters or signs along with numbers.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/android-lock-screen-settings-6.jpg"                      alt="android lock screen settings"                ></p><p>Go to the lock screen setting for PIN and then set a PIN that consists of minimum 4 digits. It’s your choice to use 4 or more digit PIN. After setting the PIN, you can access your Android device by putting the PIN in a box from the lock screen. PIN protected lock screen is highly protected if the PIN is set strongly.</p><h3 id="5-Password"><a href="#5-Password" class="headerlink" title="5.Password"></a>5.Password</h3><p>In addition to PIN protection, you can consider it as password by adding some letters, special characters with the previously selected PIN codes. It’s also very much highly protected method of locking screen though you might be bored with tapping for the password again and again. But never ignore the value of your device’s files, so a password can be a well-sought lock screen protection for many users.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/android-lock-screen-settings-7.jpg"                      alt="android lock screen settings"                ></p><h3 id="6-Fingerprint"><a href="#6-Fingerprint" class="headerlink" title="6.Fingerprint"></a>6.Fingerprint</h3><p>In some of the modern Android device, you’ll find the feature of fingerprint unlocking. You can find the option through the screen or any dedicated button. By setting your fingerprint, you can unlock your device by tapping your finger on the Lava Yuva 3 device’s screen or the dedicated button.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/android-lock-screen-settings-8.jpg"                      alt="android lock screen settings"                ></p><h3 id="7-Voice"><a href="#7-Voice" class="headerlink" title="7.Voice"></a>7.Voice</h3><p>This is also a fun way of unlocking Android lock screen as you can unlock by saying the same voice that you’ve saved as the unlocking recognition.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/android-lock-screen-settings-9.jpg"                      alt="android lock screen settings"                ></p><p>Go to the setting from “Voice Unlock” button and record your voice such as “Open My Lava Yuva 3” or as per your choice with clear sound. Repeat the voice a few more times as to match well. Then set and unlock your device from the lock screen by using the same voice command.</p><h2 id="Customize-Android-Lock-Screen"><a href="#Customize-Android-Lock-Screen" class="headerlink" title="Customize Android Lock Screen"></a>Customize Android Lock Screen</h2><p><strong>Lock Screen Widgets</strong></p><p>Widgets can be used from Android lock screen without unlocking the Lava Yuva 3 device first.

This measure is implemented to guarantee that the Lava Yuva 3 device exclusively functions with the services provided by that specific carrier. If you wish to remove the operator lock from your Lava Yuva 3  device, you’ll need to follow specific steps and meet certain criteria. Here’s how to remove the operator lock on a Lava Yuva 3 :</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Begin by checking whether your device can be unlocked or not from its network carrier restrictions. To do that, you need to dial the code “*#*#7378423#*#*” on your device, tap “Service Info” and select “SIM Lock.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/10/unlock-sony-xperia-pin-code-5.jpg"                      alt="dial the provided number"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Carefully check the information provided on the screen.

Nothing could be more frustrating than gazing at your phone, knowing that it is essentially a paperweight at this point. Unless you can get it unlocked, your phone is useless, and all of your important photos, text messages, and content are all locked out of your reach. While right now, nothing can do without a Google account. But you can try to reset your Google account first.</p><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Bypass-Lock-Screen-on-Android-device-with-Google-Account-Android-Device-Manager"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Bypass-Lock-Screen-on-Android-device-with-Google-Account-Android-Device-Manager" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to Bypass Lock Screen on Android device with Google Account (Android Device Manager)"></a>Part 1: How to Bypass Lock Screen on Android device with Google Account (Android Device Manager)</h2><p>Even if you have a Google account, if your phone isn’t connected to the internet, you cannot access it to unlock your phone. If this sounds familiar, you can always try this method.</p><p>1. First, navigate to the Android Device Manager page. You will need to sign in with the Google account that you use to set up your phone.</p><p>Android Device Manager link: <a class="link"   href="http://www.google.com/android/devicemanager" >http://www.google.com/android/devicemanager <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14637942446007.jpg"                      alt="android Device Manager log in"                ></p><p>2. Once you have logged in, you will automatically be redirected to the Android Device Manager page. If this is your first time, click the “Accept” button.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14637942473262.jpg"                      alt="android Device Manager start"                ></p><p>3. A list of all of the Motorola Moto G14 devices registered to this Android account will pop up. Select the Motorola Moto G14 device in question from this list.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14637942503282.jpg"                      alt="android Device Manager list of devices"                ></p><p>4. The Android Device Manager will then locate your device. Make sure it is turned on!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14637942532352.jpg"                      alt="android Device Manager locating device"                ></p><p>5. After it has been located, you will have a few options for what to do next. If you do not know your phone’s location, you can call it from this screen, but if you know where it is, click the ‘Enable Lock &amp; Erase’ option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14637942568385.jpg"                      alt="android Device Manager device located"                ></p><p>6. A notification will pop up on your device; confirm it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14637942582896.jpg"                      alt="android Device Manager Erase &amp; Lock"                ></p><p>7. At this point, you will be asked to create a new lock screen password. Once you have chosen one, press “Lock.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14637943377629.jpg"                      alt="android Device Manager New Lock Screen"                ></p><p>8. Now, simply enter the new passcode on your device, and voila! It will open, and you can get back to your daily routine.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2087248/19272" target="_top" id="2087248">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2087248" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2087248/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Reset-Your-Google-Account-on-your-Android-Phone"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Reset-Your-Google-Account-on-your-Android-Phone" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Reset Your Google Account on your Android Phone"></a>Part 2: How to Reset Your Google Account on your Android Phone</h2><p>If you have forgotten your Google Account password, it is still possible to unlock your account and access the information within. Here is how you can unlock your Google account on your Android phone.</p><p>1. On your browser, go to the Google home page and try to sign in. You will fail, but that is good! It will lead you to the next step.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14637535742329.jpg"                      alt="android Google web page"                ></p><p>2.

Tips, Tricks and Helpful Advice"></a>Still Using Pattern Locks with Motorola Moto G14? Tips, Tricks and Helpful Advice</h2><p>They have been along for a long, long time now – pattern locks – the easiest of all smartphone locks. You just swipe your finger across to create an <strong>easy pattern lock</strong> of your choosing and that’s it, it becomes your new screen lock. No more remembering tedious digits! So, why have these easy pattern locks become outdated, and why do people still continue to use them? Let’s take a dive and find out all about pattern locks.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/09/easy-pattern-lock-1.jpg"                      alt="creating more secure pattern locks"                ></p><h2 id="Part-I-Things-To-Know-About-Pattern-Locks"><a href="#Part-I-Things-To-Know-About-Pattern-Locks" class="headerlink" title="Part I: Things To Know About Pattern Locks"></a>Part I: Things To Know About Pattern Locks</h2><p>The first cellphone locks were 4-digit number locks. Then came 6-digit codes, and even alphanumeric ones. Pattern locks were all the rage a while ago. Though pattern locks continue to be used, they are not considered safe to use any longer. What is all that about? Here’s what you need to know about pattern locks, whether you are a seasoned pattern lock user or not.</p><h3 id="I-I-What-Are-Pattern-Locks"><a href="#I-I-What-Are-Pattern-Locks" class="headerlink" title="I.I: What Are Pattern Locks?"></a>I.I: What Are Pattern Locks?</h3><p>Believe it or not, technology has advanced at such a rapid pace in the last two decades that you’d be forgiven if you don’t know what a pattern lock is, especially if you have only ever used iPhones, or Android phones in just the last few years.</p><p>Pattern locks are patterns you create on your smartphone and designate as a smartphone lock&#x2F; screen lock. There is a 9-point keypad of sorts, and you start swiping your finger from any point to any point for any which way you feel like. Android 13 allows a minimum of 4 points registered. They are easy to create, and easy to use, hence called easy pattern locks.</p><p>Pattern locks have only ever been offered on Android devices and were commonplace a few years ago until they were deemed not secure enough for use by modern standards because they were <em>easy</em> to figure out by malicious actors.</p><h3 id="I-II-Popularity-and-Usage"><a href="#I-II-Popularity-and-Usage" class="headerlink" title="I.II: Popularity and Usage"></a>I.II: Popularity and Usage</h3><p>Pattern lock is a feature unique to Android and has been so since the start. Naturally, it is one of the preferred ways users have come to unlock their Android devices over the years. Even though modern Android smartphones come with fingerprint recognition and face recognition technologies, there exists a large subset of users still addicted to and acclimatized with the pattern lock feature, opting over fingerprint and face recognition.</p><p>There has been, however, research conducted into the safety and security offered by pattern lock in Android.</p><h3 id="I-III-Advantages-and-Drawbacks"><a href="#I-III-Advantages-and-Drawbacks" class="headerlink" title="I.III: Advantages and Drawbacks"></a>I.III: Advantages and Drawbacks</h3><p>Modern smartphones very nearly contain the entirety of our lives; photo memories, video memories, important documents both financial and personal in nature, banking apps, ID and ATM&#x2F; credit cards in the “wallet” apps, and whatnot. A smartphone falling into the wrong hands could very nearly be used to devastate the rightful owner, both financially and otherwise. And this is not a claim out of thin air; spyware&#x2F; malware&#x2F; phishing attacks are on the rise around the world. Locking the smartphone, once considered optional and an unnecessary hassle, is now an absolute must.</p><h4 id="Advantages-of-Pattern-Locks"><a href="#Advantages-of-Pattern-Locks" class="headerlink" title="Advantages of Pattern Locks"></a>Advantages of Pattern Locks</h4><p>There is no denying that using an <strong>easy pattern lock</strong> to lock their smartphone seems enough for most users. Swiping your finger across your smartphone to unlock it feels not only cool and futuristic but safer and more secure than remembering and punching in digits. And, for the most part, it is true, given that 4-digit PINs can only have 10,000 unique combinations!</p><h4 id="Disadvantages-of-Pattern-Locks"><a href="#Disadvantages-of-Pattern-Locks" class="headerlink" title="Disadvantages of Pattern Locks"></a>Disadvantages of Pattern Locks</h4><p>While very easy to use, security researchers and experts have come to agree that the feature is not in the least safe to use, and that is because of how people use the pattern lock feature (discussed in detail below in part II). Some go so far as to say that most pattern locks can be breached in just 5 attempts or less. Imagine that!</p><p>What is more, research has found that humans have an uncanny ability to correctly guess a pattern lock simply by viewing the unlocking! The test comprised showing the test subjects videos of users unlocking their phones from different angles and varying distances, and it was found that around 64% of test subjects were able to correctly guess a 6-point pattern lock in one viewing only, and 80% could correctly guess the pattern after just two viewings. By contrast, only 11% were able to correctly deduce a 6-digit PIN after one viewing, and only 27% after viewing twice. This goes to show just how insecure pattern locks are!</p><h2 id="Part-II-How-People-Use-Pattern-Locks"><a href="#Part-II-How-People-Use-Pattern-Locks" class="headerlink" title="Part II: How People Use Pattern Locks"></a>Part II: How People Use Pattern Locks</h2><p>We might wonder how anyone would be able to guess the correct pattern of our device, but believe it or not, it is possible, eerily easily at that! We are all the same humans, after all! You know how people usually set PINs that could be significant dates in their lives? How they get car registration numbers that mean something to them? The same ‘logic’ applies to their setting pattern locks.</p><p>At DEFCON 23, Marte Loge, an M.Sc. Computer Science student, presented something that stunned people around the world. She said, “Tell me who you are, and I will tell you your lock pattern.” What followed was an expert presentation outlining and detailing user behaviors around pattern locks.</p><p>These are some commonly created pattern locks by people:</p><ul><li>- shapes of alphabets,</li><li>- shapes of numerals,</li><li>- any other easy-to-make, simple shape.</li></ul><p>Marte Loge presented the image below, showing how people naturally gravitate towards creating simple shape patterns, in her research.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/09/easy-pattern-lock-2.jpg"                      alt="common pattern locks"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1374819">                    <video width="200" height="200" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1374819.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/15852-1374819">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1374819.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:125px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fthefitville.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1374819%2F15852'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1374819/15852"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>To further help you see how easy it might be for anyone to guess your pattern, Marte Loge also presented some statistics.</p><ul><li>- 77% of people started their patterns in one of the 4 corners.</li><li>- 44% of Loge’s subjects started their pattern with the first dot, the top-left one. The next number was 15% for the top-right and 14% for the bottom-left.</li><li>- These percentages did not vary much depending on left-handedness or right-handedness.</li><li>- On average, irrespective of gender, people set 5-point patterns, with 4-point patterns being the most common. This means that the number of combinations on average was 7152 for 5-point patterns and a bogglingly low 1624 for 4-point patterns.</li></ul><p>The above data makes it amply clear how using an <strong>easy pattern lock</strong> is actually worse than using a 4-digit PIN, simply because how people are usually using the pattern lock feature.</p><h2 id="Part-III-Tips-For-Using-More-Secure-Pattern-Locks"><a href="#Part-III-Tips-For-Using-More-Secure-Pattern-Locks" class="headerlink" title="Part III: Tips For Using More Secure Pattern Locks"></a>Part III: Tips For Using More Secure Pattern Locks</h2><p>Now, we know how hard it is to break habits cemented over years of use, so in case you must at all costs use a pattern lock only, the least you can do is try and change your easy pattern lock to a better, more secure hard pattern lock.</p><h4 id="III-I-How-to-Create-More-Secure-Patterns"><a href="#III-I-How-to-Create-More-Secure-Patterns" class="headerlink" title="III.I: How to Create More Secure Patterns"></a>III.I: How to Create More Secure Patterns</h4><p>Here are some tips to help you create a better, more secure pattern lock for your smartphone.</p><ul><li>- Avoid using any of the corners to start the pattern.</li><li>- Never use your first initial as a pattern.</li><li>- Never use a digit shape as a pattern.</li><li>- You can pass through the same pattern lines multiple times over. This makes it more difficult for someone to guess your pattern correctly.</li><li>- Use all 9 points on the grid while setting the pattern lock! That simple act takes the possible pattern combinations to over 140,000, significantly more than 10,000 for 4-digit PINs, and vastly superior to paltry 1624 for a 4-point <strong>easy pattern lock</strong>!</li></ul><h4 id="III-II-Forgot-Your-Pattern-Unlock-Your-Motorola-Moto-G14-Without-Pattern-Lock-With-Dr-Fone"><a href="#III-II-Forgot-Your-Pattern-Unlock-Your-Motorola-Moto-G14-Without-Pattern-Lock-With-Dr-Fone" class="headerlink" title="III.II: Forgot Your Pattern?

Among them, tap on the Security option to begin your work.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14555320015997.jpg"                      alt="disable lock screen android"                ></p><p>· Step 2: Under the heading called Screen Security heading, you will be shown 3 choices. Tap on the first one, which is entitled Screen lock.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14555321966246.jpg"                      alt="disable lock screen android"                ></p><p>· Step 3: Once you have done the previous step, a brand new screen will appear and then you will be asked to fill in your PIN code. This is a step that helps guarantee that you are the true owner of the Android device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14555322112292.jpg"                      alt="disable lock screen android"                ></p><p>Step 4: As soon as you have confirmed the right PIN code in the bar provided, you will then be presented to the next drop-down menu. A similar screen will appear which shows you plenty of choices. Tap on the top of that list, which is a bar called None.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14555322276060.jpg"                      alt="disable lock screen android"                ></p><p>Step 5: In the end, you have successfully disabled the screen lock on your Android devices. You are now capable of using it without any hesitation about the screen lock.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Common-Problems-of-Disabling-Lock-Screen"><a href="#Part-3-Common-Problems-of-Disabling-Lock-Screen" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Common Problems of Disabling Lock Screen"></a>Part 3: Common Problems of Disabling Lock Screen</h2><p>The process to disable the screen lock on Android may seem easy to handle as well as straightforward to several customers, but there are still some annoying problems that users have to deal with while trying to disable the lock screen.</p><p>What are the top 2 common problems?</p><p>Below are the two most common problems faced by Android users during their efforts to disable the feature of screen lock.</p><p><strong>1. In the Screen Security choice, the None bar can not be chosen.</strong></p><p>Description of the problem: There is a sentence below it stated: “Disabled by administrators, encryption policy or credential storage”. All the space of the None option is in white and grey.</p><p>The solution to this problem is quite simple. Once you have made sure you are suffering from this nasty one, try to follow these below pieces of advice to see if it is capable of giving you a hand.</p><p>Step 1: Open the Settings menu from the main screen. Then tap on the Credential Storage. You will see a drop-down menu like the screenshot below.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14556834486843.jpg"                      alt="disable lock screen android"                ></p><p>Step 2: Continue to tap on the Clear Credentials (Remove all certificates) option. Then next click on the OK button. Wait for some seconds until your Android device has finished the process.</p><p>Step 3: To make sure that the previous step has been performed successfully, try looking at the bottom of the drop-down menu. If the Clear Credentials (Remove all certificates) are grey out and can not be selected, then you have managed to do it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14556833184389.jpg"                      alt="disable lock screen android"                ></p><p>Step 4: Now that the problem is solved, you can feel free to turn back to your Screen lock option in the beginning and disable the feature of locking screen Android as usual.</p><p>2. You have mistakenly encrypted your SD card. You want to disable the encryption, only to realize that it requires you to set a new screen lock code. But when you come to the Screen lock menu, all the options but Password have been greyed out.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14555323367933.jpg"                      alt="disable lock screen android"                ><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14555323405268.jpg"                      alt="disable lock screen android"                ></p><p>This is pretty weird, but actually, it is one of the most common troubles that many users have complained about. But to your surprise, the solution is very simple and easy. All you have to do is to reset your password, but with a little change. Your password MUST include at least ONE NUMBER in it. Confirm your new password then you will be able to disable the lock screen Android as usual.</p><h2 id="Bonus-Tip-Remove-Android-Screen-Lock-If-Forgotten-Password-Pattern"><a href="#Bonus-Tip-Remove-Android-Screen-Lock-If-Forgotten-Password-Pattern" class="headerlink" title="Bonus Tip: Remove Android Screen Lock If Forgotten Password&#x2F;Pattern"></a>Bonus Tip: Remove Android Screen Lock If Forgotten Password&#x2F;Pattern</h2><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/68FqgS6Ym8E" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe><p>As much as the lock screen can protect the personal information on the phone, it can also cause much trouble if you forget the lock screen password or enter the wrong password too many times.

It allows you to unlock your phone bootloader. A bootloader or bootstrap loader gathers the operating system files, loads them into memory, and hands over control, essentially starting your device. Unlocking the bootloader assists you in installing custom ROMs, flashing custom kernels, and rooting your phone.</p><p>However, this freedom comes with some trade-offs. Most manufacturers will void your warranty if you unlock the bootloader, and it can also make your phone face higher risks of malware and other security threats. Additionally, it can be difficult to relock the bootloader once you unlock it.</p><p>If you encounter the <strong>OEM unlock missing</strong> on your Android phone despite wanting to unlock your bootloader, this article can help. You will learn the step-by-step guide for the different methods to fix the <strong>missing OEM unlock</strong> option. Before diving into solutions, let’s explore why this option might be unavailable in the first place.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/oem-unlock-missing-01.jpg"                      alt="using a phone at work"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-Why-Is-OEM-Unlock-Missing-on-Your-Device"><a href="#Part-1-Why-Is-OEM-Unlock-Missing-on-Your-Device" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Why Is OEM Unlock Missing on Your Device?"></a>Part 1: Why Is OEM Unlock Missing on Your Device?</h2><p>Finding that OEM Unlock is missing on your Android phones can be frustrating, particularly if you plan to modify your software or install a custom ROM. But don’t worry. There are several possible explanations for this. Let’s explore some of the most common reasons:</p><p>Manufacturer Restrictions</p><p>The <strong>Missing OEM Unlock</strong> option can often be due to restrictions imposed by your device’s manufacturers. They may intentionally remove this option to safeguard device security and compatibility. It is common with carrier-locked devices. As a result, the OEM Unlock option may not show.</p><p>Bootloader Already Unlocked</p><p>In some cases, the <strong>Android OEM Unlock Missing</strong> issue arises <a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/how-to-unlock-xiaomi-bootloader.html"><u>when the bootloader has already been unlocked</u></a>. Relocking the bootloader might make the option reappear. But exercise caution as this process can erase device data.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/oem-unlock-missing-02.jpg"                      alt="oem unlock option greyed out"                ></p><p>Developer Options Not Enabled</p><p>It might seem obvious, but sometimes the simplest things get overlooked. The OEM Unlock option can only be accessed from within Developer Options. If this menu isn’t enabled, you won’t see it.</p><p>Carrier-Locked Devices</p><p>The <strong>OEM Unlock Missing</strong> issue can also occur if your device is <a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/sim-unlock/carrier-unlock-android-phone.html"><u>carrier-locked</u></a>. Carriers often impose restrictions to prevent users from switching networks, and bootloader unlocking is one way to do that. Unfortunately, the <strong>missing OEM Unlock</strong> option is usually intentional, and unlocking your device can be more complicated.</p><p>Security Features</p><p>Enhanced security features, like Samsung’s KNOX, can sometimes conceal the OEM Unlock option. Temporarily turning off these features might show the option, but it’s crucial to be aware of the potential security implications of doing so.</p><p>Corrupted Bootloader</p><p>A corrupted bootloader can also lead to the <strong>Android OEM Unlock missing</strong> problem. The bootloader plays a role in the boot process, and if it’s damaged, it might not display the necessary options. This can be caused by software glitches, failed flashing attempts, or even <a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/device-diagnostics/how-to-run-a-hardware-test-on-xiaomi.html"><u>hardware issues</u></a>. In this scenario, you might need to consult your device’s manufacturer or a technical specialist to help repair or re-flash the bootloader.</p><p>Connectivity Issues</p><p>A poor connection between your device and computer can also prevent the OEM Unlocking from showing up. Check your cables and try using different USB ports to ensure a stable connection.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-To-Enable-Missing-OEM-Unlock-Without-a-Password"><a href="#Part-2-How-To-Enable-Missing-OEM-Unlock-Without-a-Password" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How To Enable Missing OEM Unlock Without a Password?"></a>Part 2: How To Enable Missing OEM Unlock Without a Password?</h2><p>Unlocking your phone’s bootloader (OEM Unlock) varies across models and brands. Some need a passcode or PIN after rebooting the phone, while others don’t.

But if the Android OEM unlock option is missing, you can’t unlock your device’s bootloader.

The most straightforward way is to utilize Google’s Find My Device site. So, if the Find my Device option feature is enabled on your phone, you can tap the <strong>Erase device</strong> choice on this page to reset it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/what-is-my-phone-password-3.jpg"                      alt="google find my device"                ></p><h3 id="2-Enter-Recovery-Mode-to-Hard-Reset"><a href="#2-Enter-Recovery-Mode-to-Hard-Reset" class="headerlink" title="2.

However, we suggest you try Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock for a quick and safe solution. To make things more straightforward, we have given you other techniques as a workaround to the issue.</p><p>So, keep following us to unlock the <strong>lock screen pattern</strong> and use your phone again.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-Android-Pattern"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-Android-Pattern" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Is Android Pattern?"></a>Part 1: What Is Android Pattern?</h2><p>A <strong>pattern lock</strong> is used to identify the actual user by your Android phone.

Android seems to be controlling a considerably high portion of our life. We have bought many gadgets that use this amazing OS and most of which are phones. But how much can you do with your Android phone? Developers are always making it more interesting to use this interface.</p><p>Most of the time, we use Android phones, we get faced with the need to access the internet. The Wi-Fi capability of these Android gadgets makes it super easy for us to surf the web. Throughout using Wi-Fi, we connect to a number of them. This could be at school, a sub-way café, the gym, buses, hospitals, hotels, towns, and the list is endless. A password secures most of this. Needless to say, our brain is weak to store all these passwords for future use, especially if you would want to connect with a different gadget you have recently bought or even your laptop. In this article, we will introduce you to how to find wifi password on rooted and also unrooted Android devices.</p><iframe allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/78mNMIr_wpI"></iframe><h2 id="Part-1-Show-Wifi-Password-on-Rooted-Android-Device"><a href="#Part-1-Show-Wifi-Password-on-Rooted-Android-Device" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Show Wifi Password on Rooted Android Device"></a>Part 1: Show Wifi Password on Rooted Android Device</h2><h3 id="What-is-Rooting"><a href="#What-is-Rooting" class="headerlink" title="What is Rooting?"></a>What is Rooting?</h3><p>First of all, what does rooting mean? You have probably used a Windows computer or even Linux. For the case of Windows, when installing a new program or software, it always prompts a dialog box saying, “Administrator permission required to run this program.” If you don’t have the administrator permission, you won’t install the program. In Android, this is called rooting. In simple terms, it means having the root permission to your phone. Some Android apps will require you the root permission, e.g., flashing your ROM. In this part, we will explain how you can show the Wi-Fi password on your Android with root.</p><p>To find the Wi-Fi passwords on your Android phone, you need to have an app to explore files which also supports a root user. In this case, ES FileExplorer or Root Explorer will come in handy. However, it turns out that the latter is offered at $3. Let’s use the free ES File Explorer.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14556285763404.jpg"                      alt="android show wifi password"                ></p><h3 id="Steps-of-getting-Wi-Fi-password-on-Android-with-root"><a href="#Steps-of-getting-Wi-Fi-password-on-Android-with-root" class="headerlink" title="Steps of getting Wi-Fi password on Android with root"></a>Steps of getting Wi-Fi password on Android with root</h3><p>In only four steps, we, at this moment, learn how we can find the password of a Wi-Fi on an Android phone.</p><p>Step 1: Install the ES File Explorer</p><p>Download the ES File Explorer from your play store, install it, and open it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14556286507084.jpg"                      alt="android show wifi password"                ></p><p>Step 2: Enable Root Explorer</p><p>The root explorer needs to be enabled so that you can reach the root folders of the Wi-Fi passwords you need.

It can’t recognize your face. When you try multiple times in such cases, it will lock your device permanently. Are you stuck with a locked phone? And you’re still confused about what just happened. Face unlock may face problems such as</p><ul><li>Face unlock app may be buggy</li><li>Your face unlock settings may be unstable</li><li>Your phone camera or face unlock sensor may be damaged</li><li>Someone else may have registered their face without your permission</li></ul><p>Whatever the reason, they are equally big obstacles for you to use your phone as usual; trying to unlock your device can lead to a permanently locked phone. So how do you bypass face unlock?</p><p>Follow the guide below to bypass the face unlock settings and choose the best one for yourself.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/face-unlock-android-1.jpg"                      alt="face lock"                ></p><h2 id="How-To-Bypass-Android-Face-Lock-by-Ourselves"><a href="#How-To-Bypass-Android-Face-Lock-by-Ourselves" class="headerlink" title="How To Bypass Android Face Lock by Ourselves?"></a>How To Bypass Android Face Lock by Ourselves?</h2><p>If you want to bypass face lock by yourself, then different methods can help you. These are all tested and work well.</p><h3 id="1-A-Picture-Possibly-Bypasses-Face-Lock"><a href="#1-A-Picture-Possibly-Bypasses-Face-Lock" class="headerlink" title="1. A Picture Possibly Bypasses Face Lock"></a>1. A Picture Possibly Bypasses Face Lock</h3><p>You can use your photo to manipulate the face lock app. Simply use your photo to unlock the phone, which should work fine. If your phone doesn’t recognize your face from a photo, try again.</p><p>If it still doesn’t recognize your face, try a different photo or even change the camera’s lighting settings or the angles to see if that helps.</p><p>Anyway, this method is still unstable because of many uncontrollable factors. If everything fails, consider the following methods to bypass the face lock.</p><h3 id="2-Hard-Reset-your-phone"><a href="#2-Hard-Reset-your-phone" class="headerlink" title="2. Hard Reset your phone"></a>2. Hard Reset your phone</h3><p>To get around the Android lock screen, perform a factory reset. While resetting your phone allows you to set a new password, it also erases all data from your device. This method works like a charm, but it also requires more technical knowledge. To bypass screen lock via factory reset, follow these steps.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/face-unlock-android-2.jpg"                      alt="android hard reset"                ></p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Turn off your phone and hold the Power and Volume-down buttons simultaneously until the recovery mode screen appears. There are minor variations depending on the brand and model.</p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Select the Wipe data&#x2F;Factory Reset option using the volume buttons. To confirm the option, press the Power button.</p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Choose Yes &gt; Delete All User Data, then press the power button to continue. When the process is complete, turn on your phone.</p><p>So, before facing such awkward cases, like data loss, we suggest you have a backup habit of keeping your data safe.</p><h3 id="3-Google-Find-My-Device"><a href="#3-Google-Find-My-Device" class="headerlink" title="3. Google Find My Device"></a>3. Google Find My Device</h3><p>Google Find My Device is a service that lets you remotely lock, track, and wipe data from stolen or lost phones. With a Google account and the password, it won’t be complicated to remove any locks on your phone. You can bypass the Android lock screen by following the steps below:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/face-unlock-android-3.jpg"                      alt="google find my device data reset"                ></p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Navigate to Find My Device and sign in with your Google account.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Your phone receives a notification.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Select Erase Device, confirm, and click Erase as a warning pops up on the screen.</p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> The factory reset process on your phone begins. When it’s finished, choose My Google Account instead of using your phone as if it were brand new.</p><p>Just like the hard reset, after using Google Find My Device, all your data and settings will be erased. Please make everything well prepared before you decide to unlock your device.</p><h2 id="Easiest-Way-to-Unlock-Your-Android-Face-Recognition-Using-Dr-Fone-Screen-unlock"><a href="#Easiest-Way-to-Unlock-Your-Android-Face-Recognition-Using-Dr-Fone-Screen-unlock" class="headerlink" title="Easiest Way to Unlock Your Android Face Recognition Using Dr.Fone-Screen unlock"></a>Easiest Way to Unlock Your Android Face Recognition Using Dr.Fone-Screen unlock</h2><p>The methods mentioned above may be hard for you, and you don’t know any technical skills.

This tool brings an added layer of convenience to your smartphone experience.</p><p>Let’s dig deeper into how you can <strong>use Google Assistant on the lock screen</strong> and make the most out of this tool in the following article.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/unlock-phone-with-voice-google-assistant-1.jpg"                      alt="How to use Google Assistant"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-You-Can-Do-With-Voice-Google-Assistant"><a href="#Part-1-What-You-Can-Do-With-Voice-Google-Assistant" class="headerlink" title="Part 1.

This application is readily available on most recent mobile phone models, especially those operating on Android 6.0 and newer versions.</p><p>Although you can no longer use the <strong>Google Assistant unlock</strong> feature, you can still perform a myriad of tasks using Google Assistant. These include:</p><ul><li>Getting the weather</li><li>Setting alarms</li><li>Playing music</li><li>Sending texts</li><li>Making a call</li><li>Asking Google for information, etc.</li></ul><h3 id="Enable-Google-Assistant-on-Lock-Screen-A-Step-by-Step-Guide"><a href="#Enable-Google-Assistant-on-Lock-Screen-A-Step-by-Step-Guide" class="headerlink" title="Enable Google Assistant on Lock Screen: A Step-by-Step Guide"></a>Enable Google Assistant on Lock Screen: A Step-by-Step Guide</h3><p>Now that you’re eager to try the potential of Google Assistant on your lock screen, let’s walk through the simple steps on how to enable this tool.</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open Google Assistant:</li></ul><p>Look for “Google Assistant” and open the app.</p><ul><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Ask Google Assistant to open the settings.</li></ul><p>You can ask, “Hey Google, open the Google Assistant settings,” and it will show you the Google Assistant settings.</p><ul><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Allow Google Assistant on the lock screen.</li></ul><p>Locate the “Lock Screen” settings and make sure to switch on “Assistant responses on lock screen.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/unlock-phone-with-voice-google-assistant-2.jpg"                      alt="Enable Google Assistant on the lock screen"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-To-Use-Google-Assistant-on-Lock-Screen"><a href="#Part-2-How-To-Use-Google-Assistant-on-Lock-Screen" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

How To Use Google Assistant on Lock Screen</h2><p>After you’ve successfully enabled Google Assistant on your lock screen, let’s see how to use Google Assistant to do certain tasks more efficiently and hands-free.</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Wake Up Google Assistant</li></ul><p>Start by waking up Google Assistant.

Common Problems When Using Google Assistant"></a>Part 3. Common Problems When Using Google Assistant</h2><p>Unable to use <strong>Google Assistant to unlock phone</strong> is not the only drawback that users may have encountered in recent changes. Although Google Assistant on the lock screen presents a revolutionary way to interact with your phone, like any technology, it also comes with its share of challenges. Some of the common problems when using Google Assistant are:</p><ol><li><strong>Misunderstandings and misinterpretations</strong></li></ol><p>One prevalent issue users encounter is Google Assistant misunderstanding or misinterpreting voice commands. This can be influenced by factors such as background noise, accent variations, or pronunciation differences.</p><ol start="2"><li><strong>Limited context understanding</strong></li></ol><p>While Google Assistant is adept at understanding individual commands, it may struggle with complex, multi-step requests that rely heavily on context. Break down your tasks into simpler commands to enhance comprehension and execute it more accurately.</p><ol start="3"><li><strong>Inability to execute certain tasks</strong></li></ol><p>Google Assistant’s capabilities are extensive, but there are instances where it may struggle to execute specific tasks. For example, it can’t execute tasks that involve interacting with certain third-party applications or services. You can’t also <strong>unlock phone with voice Google Assistant.</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/unlock-phone-with-voice-google-assistant-4.jpg"                      alt="Giving command to Google Asisstant on lock screen"                ></p><h3 id="Tips-to-Make-Voice-Google-Assistant-Recognize-Your-Commands"><a href="#Tips-to-Make-Voice-Google-Assistant-Recognize-Your-Commands" class="headerlink" title="Tips to Make Voice Google Assistant Recognize Your Commands"></a>Tips to Make Voice Google Assistant Recognize Your Commands</h3><p>One of the most infuriating problems with voice Google Assistant is that users often encounter difficulties in having their commands accurately recognized. To enhance the accuracy of voice recognition with Google Assistant, you can consider implementing the following tips:</p><ol><li><strong>Speak Clearly and Naturally</strong></li></ol><p>Make sure that you speak in a clear and natural manner. Avoid mumbling or speaking too quickly. Enunciate your words, giving Google Assistant a better chance to interpret your commands accurately.</p><ol start="2"><li><strong>Use Simple and Direct Phrases</strong></li></ol><p>Keep your commands simple and direct. Avoid unnecessary elaboration or complex sentence structures. Google Assistant is more likely to understand straightforward commands.</p><ol start="3"><li><strong>Check Your Microphone</strong></li></ol><p>Ensure that your device’s microphone is in good working condition. Dirt or debris on your phone’s microphone can affect its performance. Clean the microphone area and try again.</p><ol start="4"><li><strong>Quiet Environment</strong></li></ol><p>Background noise can interfere with voice recognition. Try to issue commands in a quiet environment to minimize any potential confusion caused by external sounds.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://imp.i357552.net/c/5597632/1001446/11832" target="_top" id="1001446">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/11832-1001446" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.i357552.net/i/5597632/1001446/11832"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-Unlock-Android-Phone-Screen-Without-Passcode"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-Unlock-Android-Phone-Screen-Without-Passcode" class="headerlink" title="Part 4.
