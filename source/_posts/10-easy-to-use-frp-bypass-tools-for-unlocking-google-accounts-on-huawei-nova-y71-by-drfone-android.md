## Part 1. What You Can Do With Voice Google Assistant

Google Assistant is a virtual assistant powered by artificial intelligence (AI) developed by tech giant Google. This application is readily available on most recent mobile phone models, especially those operating on Android 6.0 and newer versions.

Although you can no longer use the **Google Assistant unlock** feature, you can still perform a myriad of tasks using Google Assistant. These include:

- Getting the weather
- Setting alarms
- Playing music
- Sending texts
- Making a call
- Asking Google for information, etc.

### Enable Google Assistant on Lock Screen: A Step-by-Step Guide

Now that you're eager to try the potential of Google Assistant on your lock screen, let's walk through the simple steps on how to enable this tool.

- **Step 1:** Open Google Assistant:

Look for "Google Assistant" and open the app.

- **Step 2:** Ask Google Assistant to open the settings.

You can ask, "Hey Google, open the Google Assistant settings," and it will show you the Google Assistant settings.

- **Step 3:** Allow Google Assistant on the lock screen.

Locate the “Lock Screen” settings and make sure to switch on “Assistant responses on lock screen.”

## Part 2. How To Use Google Assistant on Lock Screen

After you've successfully enabled Google Assistant on your lock screen, let's see how to use Google Assistant to do certain tasks more efficiently and hands-free.

- **Step 1:** Wake Up Google Assistant

Start by waking up Google Assistant. You can do this by saying the wake word "Hey Google" or "OK Google." If it doesn’t work, you can long-press the home button or use any dedicated gesture to activate Google Assistant.

- **Step 2:** Issue a Voice Command

Once Google Assistant is active, issue a voice command related to the task you want to perform. For example:

"Hey Google, what's the weather today?"

"OK Google, set an alarm for 5 PM."

"Hey Google, play my Spotify playlist."

When you can still **unlock with Google Assistant**, you can ask it to “unlock my phone” or use any similar command.

- **Step 3:** Interact with Responses

Google Assistant will then provide spoken responses and display relevant information on the lock screen. For instance, if you ask for the weather, it might verbally provide the current conditions and display a brief summary on your lock screen.

### Tips to Make Voice Google Assistant Recognize Your Commands

One of the most infuriating problems with voice Google Assistant is that users often encounter difficulties in having their commands accurately recognized. To enhance the accuracy of voice recognition with Google Assistant, you can consider implementing the following tips:

1. **Speak Clearly and Naturally**

Make sure that you speak in a clear and natural manner. Avoid mumbling or speaking too quickly. Enunciate your words, giving Google Assistant a better chance to interpret your commands accurately.

2. **Use Simple and Direct Phrases**

Keep your commands simple and direct. Avoid unnecessary elaboration or complex sentence structures. Google Assistant is more likely to understand straightforward commands.

3. **Check Your Microphone**

Ensure that your device's microphone is in good working condition. Dirt or debris on your phone's microphone can affect its performance. Clean the microphone area and try again.

4. **Quiet Environment**

Background noise can interfere with voice recognition. Try to issue commands in a quiet environment to minimize any potential confusion caused by external sounds.

![Minimal adb and fastboot folder](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/06/14648313625020.jpg)

**Step 5.** Inside the folder, hold the Shift key on your keyboard, then right-click your mouse. An additional "Open command window here" will appear so select that.

**Step 6.** ADB terminal will pop out. Now, the first is to type in ADB _devices_. This is to check if your device is recognized by ADB. If there is no device listed below, try to remove and reconnect your Huawei Nova Y71 and retype the command. If there are listed devices already, proceed.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
**Step 7.** Finally, type in the following commands **one by one****.** These commands will remove your lock screen.

- _adb shell_
- _cd /data/data/com.android.providers.settings/databases_
- _sqlite3 settings.db_
- _update system set value=0 where_
- _name='lock\_pattern\_autolock';_
- _update system set value=0 where_
- _name='lockscreen.lockedoutpermanently';_
- _.quit_

![Minimal adb and fastboot adb shell command](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/06/14648317729484.jpg)

This would work if you have your USB debugging turned on before it was locked. That's how to unlock Android using ADB.

## Part 4: How to Unlock Phone via Find My Device (with Data Loss)

Google Find My Device is another handy way to unlock your locked Android device. However, it requires you to have your Google ID credentials and you have previously enabled Find My Device features. Moreover, it will erase all the data on your device. Use the following steps to unlock your Android phone via Find My Device:

**Step 1:** Open a web browser on a computer or another device and visit the Find My Device website. Now, sign in with the Google account that is linked to the locked Android device.

**Step 2:** After signing in, you will see a list of devices associated with your Google account on the left side of the screen. Select the locked Android device from the list and choose the "Erase Device" option from the menu on the left-hand side.

![tap on erase device option](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/09/unlock-android-phone-1.jpg)

**Step 3:** You will now be asked to confirm your identity through a Google account password or using a pass-key. Afterward, follow the on-screen instructions to erase and unlock your Android device.

## Part 5: How to Unlock Android Phone without Losing Data in Safe Mode

One way to unlock your Android phone without losing the data is by utilizing Safe Mode. This method works only if the screen lock you have been using is a third-party app. Since Safe Mode disables third-party apps, you can easily use it to uninstall the problematic app. Here is **how to unlock an Android phone without losing data**:

**Step 1:** On your Android device, press and hold “Power” and “Volume Down” keys together for 3 seconds. After the Power menu becomes visible, press and hold the “Power off” option.

**Step 2:** After a while, you will see the "Safe Mode" option on your screen with some basic instructions. Now, you can use the button to boot into Safe Mode and remove the screen lock application.
