Regardless of which method you use, you will be able to unlock your phone! So, let’s get started!

## 1\. How to Unlock Samsung Galaxy M54 5G  With Google Find My Samsung Galaxy M54 5G?

A way to unlock the Samsung Galaxy M54 5G  phone is via Google Find My Device feature. While this method can help unlock your phone, it erases all content from it.

![google account verification](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/05/google-account-verification.jpg)

 And then select “**Erase Device.**”

![select erase data](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/05/select-erase-device.jpg)

Use this method only if your phone is backed up so you can restore all your data later.
