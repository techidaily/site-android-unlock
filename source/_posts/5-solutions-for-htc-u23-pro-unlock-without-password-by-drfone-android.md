## Part 1: Lock System About HTC U23 Pro  

### 1: Lock Types

Before we move towards the **HTC U23 Pro  pattern unlock**, let's talk about its lock types and security system. HTC U23 Pro  is one of the older versions of HTC  android phones that was released in 2016. At that time, only flagship phones from each brand came with features like fingerprint sensors and facial unlock. HTC U23 Pro  doesn't offer these lock types. You can only set up a screen lock as a password, pattern, and PIN. You can also lock apps on HTC U23 Pro  with its privacy password settings.

### 2: How to Set Them up?

Follow these steps to set up any type of lock on your HTC U23 Pro  .

- Open “Settings” on your mobile and select "Lockscreen and Password".

Most people use it to factory reset their phones when someone steals their phones. Although Google Find My Device works every time, it is not the ideal solution if you don't want to lose your data. With a hard reset, you lose all your data and settings. It is not worth it if all you want to do is unlock your screen. Here are the steps to unlock HTC U23 Pro  with Find My Device.

Every step is easy to follow, and it only takes a few minutes for you to unlock your phone. This method requires your Google account and password.

Do a hard reset if you can't remember your Google account password and don't want to use third-party tools. The only problem with hard resetting is that you lose all your data, images, files, settings, and personalization. That is why you can't recover any of your data after the hard reset if you don't have a data backup. The process of hard reset is different for every device. Here are the steps for **HTC U23 Pro  pattern unlock without a PC** through a hard reset.

- Switch off your HTC U23 Pro  with the power button.

## How to Unlock a Network Locked HTC U23 Pro Phone?

Revolutions in the telecommunication industry have introduced advancements in smartphone features and utilities. The other side of the coin is, however, not as appealing. Thanks to the different carrier services, network locking is the commonest issue of recent mobile launches. Users have reported of HTC U23 Pro phones refusing to work with different carriers.

The issue limits the smartphone's functioning to the specific carrier from whom the HTC U23 Pro device is purchased. Consequently, there are annoying connectivity problems that restrict seamless mobile usage. The problem aggravates in geo-restricted regions where the carrier options are quite limited. This scenario puts forward the need for **HTC U23 Pro network unlock** solutions.

![unlock a network locked HTC U23 Pro phone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/08/how-to-unlock-a-network-locked-oneplus-phone-01.jpg)

## Part 1: What Does It Mean When Your HTC U23 Pro Phone is Network Locked?

In the simplest words, a network-locked HTC U23 Pro phone means that your device has become carrier-specific. It will now work only with the network provider from where the phone was purchased. Another problem is that there is no automatic unlocking even after the expiry of your contract with the carrier service. Having a network-locked HTC U23 Pro phone poses undesired connectivity issues.

### 1\. Why is my phone locked to the network carrier?

Smartphones are network locked by carrier services to prevent customers from switching to a different carrier. Reasons for switching can be the availability of better plans, discounts, etc. Another cause of locking the phones to specific carriers is preventing them from theft and unauthorized usage.

### 2\. Is it legal to unlock it?

Unlocking your network-locked phone is legal in every sense. It is however advisable to contact your service provider for addressing the concern. The only downside of unlocking such phones is the loss of device warranty assured at the time of purchase.
