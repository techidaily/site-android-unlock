This method does not work on all Huawei  devices, but you can use it for **Huawei Nova Y71  screen unlock without PC**. You will see various questions if your Google account is linked with the Huawei Nova Y71 device. All questions are based on your profile and credentials. You have to answer precisely with proper spaces. Here are the steps to unlock Huawei Nova Y71  with security questions.

### 4: Hard Reset (data loss)

A hard reset would be the best solution if you forgot your phone's lock screen password or pattern. However, you can unlock your phone with your Google account as well. Do a hard reset if you can't remember your Google account password and don't want to use third-party tools. The only problem with hard resetting is that you lose all your data, images, files, settings, and personalization. That is why you can't recover any of your data after the hard reset if you don't have a data backup. The process of hard reset is different for every device. Here are the steps for **Huawei Nova Y71  pattern unlock without a PC** through a hard reset.

- Switch off your Huawei Nova Y71  with the power button.
