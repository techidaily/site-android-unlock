## Part 1: Lock System About Huawei P60  

### 1: Lock Types

Before we move towards the **Huawei P60  pattern unlock**, let's talk about its lock types and security system. Huawei P60  is one of the older versions of Huawei  android phones that was released in 2016. At that time, only flagship phones from each brand came with features like fingerprint sensors and facial unlock. Huawei P60  doesn't offer these lock types. You can only set up a screen lock as a password, pattern, and PIN. You can also lock apps on Huawei P60  with its privacy password settings.

### 2: How to Set Them up?

Follow these steps to set up any type of lock on your Huawei P60  .

- Open “Settings” on your mobile and select "Lockscreen and Password".
- The lock system menu would appear if your device had no screen locks. If your device has a screen lock, you will have to enter the password to enter the settings.
- Select the "Lockscreen Password" option at the top and tap on the "Enable Lock Screen" button.

Most people use it to factory reset their phones when someone steals their phones. Although Google Find My Device works every time, it is not the ideal solution if you don't want to lose your data. With a hard reset, you lose all your data and settings. It is not worth it if all you want to do is unlock your screen. Here are the steps to unlock Huawei P60  with Find My Device.

Every step is easy to follow, and it only takes a few minutes for you to unlock your phone. This method requires your Google account and password. Don't use this method if you don't know your Google password. If you are a beginner, it is better to use other methods because this method involves the risk of blocking your device. Follow these steps to unlock your Huawei  device using your Google Account.

Here are the steps for **Huawei P60  pattern unlock without a PC** through a hard reset.

- Switch off your Huawei P60  with the power button.

## How to Unlock a Network Locked Huawei P60 Phone?

Revolutions in the telecommunication industry have introduced advancements in smartphone features and utilities. The other side of the coin is, however, not as appealing. Thanks to the different carrier services, network locking is the commonest issue of recent mobile launches. Users have reported of Huawei P60 phones refusing to work with different carriers.

The issue limits the smartphone's functioning to the specific carrier from whom the Huawei P60 device is purchased. Consequently, there are annoying connectivity problems that restrict seamless mobile usage. The problem aggravates in geo-restricted regions where the carrier options are quite limited. This scenario puts forward the need for **Huawei P60 network unlock** solutions.

## Part 1: What Does It Mean When Your Huawei P60 Phone is Network Locked?

In the simplest words, a network-locked Huawei P60 phone means that your device has become carrier-specific. It will now work only with the network provider from where the phone was purchased.

### 1\. Why is my phone locked to the network carrier?

Smartphones are network locked by carrier services to prevent customers from switching to a different carrier.

### 2\. Is it legal to unlock it?

Unlocking your network-locked phone is legal in every sense. It is however advisable to contact your service provider for addressing the concern. The only downside of unlocking such phones is the loss of device warranty assured at the time of purchase.
