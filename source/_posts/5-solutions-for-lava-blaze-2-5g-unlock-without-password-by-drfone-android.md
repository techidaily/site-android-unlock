## Part 1: Lock System About Lava Blaze 2 5G  

### 1: Lock Types

Before we move towards the **Lava Blaze 2 5G  pattern unlock**, let's talk about its lock types and security system. Lava Blaze 2 5G  is one of the older versions of Lava  android phones that was released in 2016. At that time, only flagship phones from each brand came with features like fingerprint sensors and facial unlock. Lava Blaze 2 5G  doesn't offer these lock types. You can only set up a screen lock as a password, pattern, and PIN. You can also lock apps on Lava Blaze 2 5G  with its privacy password settings.
