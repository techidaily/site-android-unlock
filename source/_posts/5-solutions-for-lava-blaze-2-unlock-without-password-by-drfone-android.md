### 1: Lock Types

Before we move towards the **Lava Blaze 2  pattern unlock**, let's talk about its lock types and security system. Lava Blaze 2  is one of the older versions of Lava  android phones that was released in 2016. At that time, only flagship phones from each brand came with features like fingerprint sensors and facial unlock. Lava Blaze 2  doesn't offer these lock types. You can only set up a screen lock as a password, pattern, and PIN. You can also lock apps on Lava Blaze 2  with its privacy password settings.

### 2: How to Set Them up?

Follow these steps to set up any type of lock on your Lava Blaze 2  .

- Open “Settings” on your mobile and select "Lockscreen and Password".
- The lock system menu would appear if your device had no screen locks. If your device has a screen lock, you will have to enter the password to enter the settings.
- Select the "Lockscreen Password" option at the top and tap on the "Enable Lock Screen" button.
- Select the type of lock you want to set and create a password.
