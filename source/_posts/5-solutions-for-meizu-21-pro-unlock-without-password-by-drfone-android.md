## Part 1: Lock System About Meizu 21 Pro  

### 1: Lock Types

Before we move towards the **Meizu 21 Pro  pattern unlock**, let's talk about its lock types and security system. Meizu 21 Pro  is one of the older versions of Meizu  android phones that was released in 2016. At that time, only flagship phones from each brand came with features like fingerprint sensors and facial unlock. Meizu 21 Pro  doesn't offer these lock types. You can only set up a screen lock as a password, pattern, and PIN. You can also lock apps on Meizu 21 Pro  with its privacy password settings.

### 2: How to Set Them up?

Follow these steps to set up any type of lock on your Meizu 21 Pro  .

- Open “Settings” on your mobile and select "Lockscreen and Password".
- The lock system menu would appear if your device had no screen locks. If your device has a screen lock, you will have to enter the password to enter the settings.
- Select the "Lockscreen Password" option at the top and tap on the "Enable Lock Screen" button.
- Select the type of lock you want to set and create a password.

### 3: How to Remove Them with Password or Pattern?

You can easily remove the lock screen of your Meizu 21 Pro  if you remember your password or pattern.

### 1: Google Find My Device

You can use the Google Find My Device for your **Meizu 21 Pro  pattern unlock**. It is a simple privacy and security Google feature that enables users to reset their android phones.

With a hard reset, you lose all your data and settings. It is not worth it if all you want to do is unlock your screen. Here are the steps to unlock Meizu 21 Pro  with Find My Device.

### 3: Answer Security Questions

If you want to unlock your Meizu  phone, you can also answer some security questions and reset the password. This method does not work on all Meizu  devices, but you can use it for **Meizu 21 Pro  screen unlock without PC**. You will see various questions if your Google account is linked with the Meizu 21 Pro device. All questions are based on your profile and credentials. You have to answer precisely with proper spaces. Here are the steps to unlock Meizu 21 Pro  with security questions.

### 4: Hard Reset (data loss)

A hard reset would be the best solution if you forgot your phone's lock screen password or pattern. However, you can unlock your phone with your Google account as well. Do a hard reset if you can't remember your Google account password and don't want to use third-party tools. The only problem with hard resetting is that you lose all your data, images, files, settings, and personalization. That is why you can't recover any of your data after the hard reset if you don't have a data backup. The process of hard reset is different for every device. Here are the steps for **Meizu 21 Pro  pattern unlock without a PC** through a hard reset.

- Switch off your Meizu 21 Pro  with the power button.
