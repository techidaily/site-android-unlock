Do a hard reset if you can't remember your Google account password and don't want to use third-party tools. The only problem with hard resetting is that you lose all your data, images, files, settings, and personalization. That is why you can't recover any of your data after the hard reset if you don't have a data backup. The process of hard reset is different for every device. Here are the steps for **Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5  pattern unlock without a PC** through a hard reset.

- Switch off your Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5  with the power button.
