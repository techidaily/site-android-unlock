## Part 1: Lock System About Samsung Galaxy M14 4G  

### 1: Lock Types

Before we move towards the **Samsung Galaxy M14 4G  pattern unlock**, let's talk about its lock types and security system. Samsung Galaxy M14 4G  is one of the older versions of Samsung  android phones that was released in 2016.

- Open “Settings” on your mobile and select "Lockscreen and Password".
- The lock system menu would appear if your device had no screen locks. If your device has a screen lock, you will have to enter the password to enter the settings.

## Part 2: 5 Solutions to Unlock Samsung Galaxy M14 4G  Without Password or Pattern

Most people use it to factory reset their phones when someone steals their phones. Although Google Find My Device works every time, it is not the ideal solution if you don't want to lose your data. With a hard reset, you lose all your data and settings. It is not worth it if all you want to do is unlock your screen. Here are the steps to unlock Samsung Galaxy M14 4G  with Find My Device.

Every step is easy to follow, and it only takes a few minutes for you to unlock your phone. This method requires your Google account and password. Don't use this method if you don't know your Google password. If you are a beginner, it is better to use other methods because this method involves the risk of blocking your device. Follow these steps to unlock your Samsung  device using your Google Account.

Do a hard reset if you can't remember your Google account password and don't want to use third-party tools. The only problem with hard resetting is that you lose all your data, images, files, settings, and personalization.

Here are the steps for **Samsung Galaxy M14 4G  pattern unlock without a PC** through a hard reset.

- Switch off your Samsung Galaxy M14 4G  with the power button.
