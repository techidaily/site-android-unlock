Follow these steps to unlock your Vivo  device using your Google Account.

![Vivo S17 Pro  lock screen](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/oppo-a37-password-unlock-02.jpg)

### 3: Answer Security Questions

This method does not work on all Vivo  devices, but you can use it for **Vivo S17 Pro  screen unlock without PC**. You will see various questions if your Google account is linked with the Vivo S17 Pro device. All questions are based on your profile and credentials. You have to answer precisely with proper spaces. Here are the steps to unlock Vivo S17 Pro  with security questions.

### 4: Hard Reset (data loss)

A hard reset would be the best solution if you forgot your phone's lock screen password or pattern. However, you can unlock your phone with your Google account as well. Do a hard reset if you can't remember your Google account password and don't want to use third-party tools. The only problem with hard resetting is that you lose all your data, images, files, settings, and personalization. That is why you can't recover any of your data after the hard reset if you don't have a data backup. The process of hard reset is different for every device. Here are the steps for **Vivo S17 Pro  pattern unlock without a PC** through a hard reset.

- Switch off your Vivo S17 Pro  with the power button.
