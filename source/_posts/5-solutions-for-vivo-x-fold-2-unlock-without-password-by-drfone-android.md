### 1: Lock Types

Before we move towards the **Vivo X Fold 2  pattern unlock**, let's talk about its lock types and security system.

At that time, only flagship phones from each brand came with features like fingerprint sensors and facial unlock. Vivo X Fold 2  doesn't offer these lock types. You can only set up a screen lock as a password, pattern, and PIN. You can also lock apps on Vivo X Fold 2  with its privacy password settings.

Follow these steps to set up any type of lock on your Vivo X Fold 2  .

- Open “Settings” on your mobile and select "Lockscreen and Password".

Most people use it to factory reset their phones when someone steals their phones. Although Google Find My Device works every time, it is not the ideal solution if you don't want to lose your data. With a hard reset, you lose all your data and settings. It is not worth it if all you want to do is unlock your screen. Here are the steps to unlock Vivo X Fold 2  with Find My Device.

## Method 3: Factory Reset Vivo X Fold 2  Phones (Wipes User Data)

There is a standard factory reset built into every Vivo X Fold 2  phone to allow users to erase the Vivo X Fold 2 device and start over fully. This option wipes all user data and resets the phone to how you received it in the box. Naturally, this is not a preferred way, as it requires the phone to be set up all over again and that takes time. Also, all data will need to be backed up beforehand in order to restore it again. Overall, this method consumes a lot of time.

**Step 1:** Go to Settings > Backup & Reset.

**Step 2:** Tap Factory Reset > Reset Phone.

**Step 3:** Tap Erase Everything.

## Method 4: Use Google Find My Device To Unlock Vivo X Fold 2  Phones (Wipes User Data)

Using Find My Device, you can play a sound on the Vivo X Fold 2 device to locate it in the house if you have misplaced it, lock the phone in case it is lost, and wipe the Vivo X Fold 2 device remotely.

**Step 1:** Go to <https://accounts.google.com>.

**Step 1:** Navigate to Settings > Security > Screen Lock.

**Step 2:** Enter the PIN or pattern.

**Step 3:** Choose None and confirm.
