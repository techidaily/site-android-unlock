### 1: Lock Types

Before we move towards the **Vivo Y100  pattern unlock**, let's talk about its lock types and security system. Vivo Y100  is one of the older versions of Vivo  android phones that was released in 2016.

You can only set up a screen lock as a password, pattern, and PIN. You can also lock apps on Vivo Y100  with its privacy password settings.

### 4: Hard Reset (data loss)

A hard reset would be the best solution if you forgot your phone's lock screen password or pattern. However, you can unlock your phone with your Google account as well.

Here are the steps for **Vivo Y100  pattern unlock without a PC** through a hard reset.

- Switch off your Vivo Y100  with the power button.
