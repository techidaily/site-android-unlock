## Part 1: Unlock Your Locked Screen Without Password By 6 Efficient Ways

### 1\. By your Google account

You can use your Google Account to unlock the Android phone password if, after several tries, you are still unable to do so without doing a factory reset.

You need to log into the Google account that is associated with the Vivo Y78 5G device, then do the following:

- The unlock pattern may only be used five times before a notification telling you to try again in 30 seconds appears.
- "Forgot pattern" will show up at the bottom of the screen.

![unlock with security question](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/howt-to-unlock-your-phone-without-password-1.jpg)

- You must enter the Gmail account that is associated with the Vivo Y78 5G device here before selecting "Next."

![answer the security question](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/howt-to-unlock-your-phone-without-password-2.jpg)

- That's it; from this point forward, you may enter any new PIN or pattern that you can recall to unlock your smartphone.

### 2\. Google Find My Device

Using your Google account is a superb method for finding the Vivo Y78 5G device when lost or stolen.

In addition, it may be used to lock or ring your smartphone. You may have noticed that there are three options available when using this feature: "Ring," "Lock," and "Erase."

To bypass the Android lock screen, all you need to do is sign into the Vivo Y78 5G device's associated Google account and then follow these steps:

- On any Android device or a computer, go to <www.google.com/android/find> and sign in using your Google account. Choose the Android smartphone you wish to unlock after that.

Many Samsung customers have this issue, which prevents them from using their devices. Try using the "Find My Mobile" feature on your mobile if you wish to unlock it if you're a Samsung user. It would be helpful if you had a Samsung or Android model account.

After that, use Find My Device to unlock your Android phone without losing any data by following the instructions below:

- Use the Volume Down key to highlight Wipe data/factory reset when the Android system recovery option displays, then hit the Power/Bixby key to choose it.
