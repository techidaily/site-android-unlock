## Way 1. Try Face or Fingerprint to Unlock Lava Blaze 2 5G Phone

How to unlock your phone when you forget the password? If you've forgotten your Android phone's password, the best way to unlock it is to use your device's built-in biometric authentication features, such as face unlock or fingerprint unlock.

Face unlock uses your device's front-facing camera to recognize your face and unlock your phone. And fingerprint unlock uses your device's fingerprint scanner to recognize your fingerprint and unlock your phone. Both of these methods are very secure. And they can quickly and easily unlock your phone without having to remember your password.
