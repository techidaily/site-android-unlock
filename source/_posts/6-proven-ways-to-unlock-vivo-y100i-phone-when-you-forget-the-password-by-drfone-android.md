## Way 1. Try Face or Fingerprint to Unlock Vivo Y100i Phone

How to unlock your phone when you forget the password? If you've forgotten your Android phone's password, the best way to unlock it is to use your device's built-in biometric authentication features, such as face unlock or fingerprint unlock.

Face unlock uses your device's front-facing camera to recognize your face and unlock your phone. And fingerprint unlock uses your device's fingerprint scanner to recognize your fingerprint and unlock your phone. Both of these methods are very secure. And they can quickly and easily unlock your phone without having to remember your password.

## Rootjunky APK To Bypass Google FRP Lock For Vivo Y100i 

Factory Reset Protection (FRP) is a security feature built into Android devices running Android 5.1 Lollipop and later versions. It prevents someone from using your phone after a factory data reset without Google account login credentials. The FRP makes it much less attractive for thieves to steal Android phones, knowing they will need help to access them.

FRP automatically activates when you add a Google account to your Android phone. It links the Vivo Y100i device to your account, making it the “trusted owner.” Once activated, FRP becomes embedded in the phone’s system.

While Google FRP is a valuable security feature, it’s vital to acknowledge that there are legitimate situations where bypassing it might be necessary. These instances include forgotten Google account credentials, buying a second-hand device, and device issues. In these cases, tools like **RootJunky** can help you [<u>bypass FRP Lock</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/google-frp-unlock/bypass-frp-with-computer.html).
