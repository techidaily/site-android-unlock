## Method 3: Factory Reset Motorola G24 Power  Phones (Wipes User Data)

This option wipes all user data and resets the phone to how you received it in the box.

Overall, this method consumes a lot of time.

**Step 1:** Go to Settings > Backup & Reset.

**Step 2:** Tap Factory Reset > Reset Phone.

**Step 3:** Tap Erase Everything.

## Method 4: Use Google Find My Device To Unlock Motorola G24 Power  Phones (Wipes User Data)

Using Find My Device, you can play a sound on the Motorola G24 Power device to locate it in the house if you have misplaced it, lock the phone in case it is lost, and wipe the Motorola G24 Power device remotely.

**Step 1:** Go to <https://accounts.google.com>.
