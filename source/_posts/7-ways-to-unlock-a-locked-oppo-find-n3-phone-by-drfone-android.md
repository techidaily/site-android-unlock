## Method 3: Factory Reset Oppo Find N3  Phones (Wipes User Data)

There is a standard factory reset built into every Oppo Find N3  phone to allow users to erase the Oppo Find N3 device and start over fully. This option wipes all user data and resets the phone to how you received it in the box. Naturally, this is not a preferred way, as it requires the phone to be set up all over again and that takes time. Also, all data will need to be backed up beforehand in order to restore it again. Overall, this method consumes a lot of time.

**Step 1:** Go to Settings > Backup & Reset.

**Step 2:** Tap Factory Reset > Reset Phone.

**Step 3:** Tap Erase Everything.
