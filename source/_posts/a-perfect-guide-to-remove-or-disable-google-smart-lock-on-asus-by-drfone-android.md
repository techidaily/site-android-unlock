<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 1\. Password Autofill

Google Smart Lock simplifies the login process across apps and websites. It does that by automatically filling in saved credentials. This eliminates the need for users to remember and manually input passwords.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 2\. Cross-Platform Synchronization

It synchronizes saved passwords across multiple devices using the same Google account. This ensures smooth access to credentials on Android devices and computers.

### 3\. Secure Storage

Passwords stored within Google Smart Lock are encrypted and securely stored in the user's Google account. This maintains confidentiality and safeguards sensitive login information.

### 4\. Effortless Password Generation

It allows the creation of strong and unique passwords when signing up for new accounts. That enhances overall account security and allows users to have strong passwords.

These features significantly ease the burden of password management and enhance user security. Yet, **Google Smart Lock** does have limitations that prompt some users to consider removing it.

## Part 3. Why Is It Essential To Remove Google Smart Lock?

Despite its array of benefits, there are times when users consider removing or disabling Google Smart Lock. Described below are these limitations to better grasp why users might choose to **Google Smart Lock turn off**:

### 1\. Privacy Concerns

Some users focus on privacy and feel uncomfortable with Google Smart Lock's access to their passwords. The reason behind this is how easily anyone can access the saved password. All they need to do is access "Manage Passwords" in Google Chrome, and all their passwords will be open. This leads them to opt for more private password management options.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 2\. Glitches and Technical Issues

Technical glitches in the functioning of Google Smart Lock can be frustrating. This is especially prominent when managing passwords with similar usernames across different websites. The same can happen when using similar passwords for different websites or apps. Users experiencing such issues can seek to remove it to restore regular operations.

### 3\. No Updates

You should be aware that Google Smart Lock for Passwords has been deprecated. This indicates it no longer receives updates or support from Google. Developers are advised to opt for Google's One Tap Sign-in feature as an alternative by Google. It provides a more efficient and secure method for signing in to apps and websites.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 4\. Preference for Third-Party Tools

Certain users might have a preference for specialized third-party password management tools. They can go for solutions that offer a wider array of features. Many users might want to find options better aligned with their specific needs. This prompts them to disable Google Smart Lock.

## Part 3: Common Problems of Disabling Lock Screen

The process to disable the screen lock on Android may seem easy to handle as well as straightforward to several customers, but there are still some annoying problems that users have to deal with while trying to disable the lock screen.

What are the top 2 common problems?

Below are the two most common problems faced by Android users during their efforts to disable the feature of screen lock.

**1\. In the Screen Security choice, the None bar can not be chosen.**

Description of the problem: There is a sentence below it stated: "Disabled by administrators, encryption policy or credential storage". All the space of the None option is in white and grey.

The solution to this problem is quite simple. Once you have made sure you are suffering from this nasty one, try to follow these below pieces of advice to see if it is capable of giving you a hand.

Step 1: Open the Settings menu from the main screen. Then tap on the Credential Storage. You will see a drop-down menu like the screenshot below.

![disable lock screen android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14556834486843.jpg)

Step 2: Continue to tap on the Clear Credentials (Remove all certificates) option. Then next click on the OK button. Wait for some seconds until your Android device has finished the process.

Step 3: To make sure that the previous step has been performed successfully, try looking at the bottom of the drop-down menu. If the Clear Credentials (Remove all certificates) are grey out and can not be selected, then you have managed to do it.

![disable lock screen android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14556833184389.jpg)

Step 4: Now that the problem is solved, you can feel free to turn back to your Screen lock option in the beginning and disable the feature of locking screen Android as usual.

2\. You have mistakenly encrypted your SD card. You want to disable the encryption, only to realize that it requires you to set a new screen lock code. But when you come to the Screen lock menu, all the options but Password have been greyed out.
