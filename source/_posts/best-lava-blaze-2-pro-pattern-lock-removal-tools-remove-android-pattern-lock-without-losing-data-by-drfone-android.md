## Part 1: What Does It Mean When Your Lava Blaze 2 Pro Phone is Network Locked?

In the simplest words, a network-locked Lava Blaze 2 Pro phone means that your device has become carrier-specific. It will now work only with the network provider from where the phone was purchased. Another problem is that there is no automatic unlocking even after the expiry of your contract with the carrier service. Having a network-locked Lava Blaze 2 Pro phone poses undesired connectivity issues.

Smartphones are network locked by carrier services to prevent customers from switching to a different carrier. Reasons for switching can be the availability of better plans, discounts, etc. Another cause of locking the phones to specific carriers is preventing them from theft and unauthorized usage.
