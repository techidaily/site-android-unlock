Just like Android, Samsung has also developed a dedicated feature for finding a device remotely and performing various other operations on it. The Samsung Find My Mobile service can be used to locate your device, change its lock, wipe its data, and perform a few other tasks as well. Needless to say, the service only works for Samsung Android devices. You can learn how to unlock patterns with this tool by following these instructions:

- **Step 1.** Go to Samsung’s Find my Mobile official website <https://findmymobile.samsung.com/> and log in using your Samsung account credentials.

- **Step 5.** After unlocking your Samsung device, you will be informed of an on-screen message.

## Part 5: How to Unlock Android Pattern Lock in Safe Mode?

This is a simple and effective solution to knowing how to unlock patterns on an Android device. Nevertheless, this solution will only work for third-party lock screen apps. If you are using your phone’s native lock feature, then it might not work. After restarting your phone in Safe Mode, you can easily move past its pattern lock without any trouble. All you need to do is follow these steps:

- **Step 1.** Simply press the Power button on your device to get the Power menu on its screen.
- **Step 2.** Now, tap and hold the “Power off” option.

![power off android phone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/09/15057373454386.jpg)

- **Step 3.** This will display the following pop-up message. Agree to it and restart your phone in Safe Mode.
- **Step 4.** Once the Samsung Galaxy F04 device would be restarted in Safe Mode, the third-party lock screen would be disabled automatically.

![android safe mode](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/09/15057373753769.jpg)

- **Step 5.** Later, you can go to the Samsung Galaxy F04 device’s Settings > Apps and remove the third-party app as well. In this way, you would be able to learn how to unlock pattern lock for any other app.

## Part 6: How to Unlock Pattern Lock with the Factory Reset?

Consider this as your last resort, as it will wipe the data and saved settings on your device entirely. As the name suggests, your device would be restored to its factory setting by losing its data. Though, if you wish to learn how to unlock a pattern by performing a factory reset, then you can perform these steps:

- **Step 1.** To start with, enter the Recovery Mode on your device. This can be done by pressing the Home, Power, and Volume Up key at the same time.
- **Step 2.** Though, the correct key combination might differ from one version of the Android device to another.
- **Step 3.** Use the Volume Up and Down key to navigate and the Power/Home button to make a choice.

![boot in recovery mode](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/09/15057373935558.jpg)

- **Step 4.** Select the wipe data/factory reset option to perform pattern unlock.
- **Step 5.** Confirm your choice to factory reset your device.

- **Step 7.** Later, you can choose to reboot your phone and access it without any lock screen.
