You can use the Safe Mode to remove the problematic app. Safe Mode is intended for troubleshooting and disabling third-party apps. Following are the steps you need to follow to use Safe Mode to unlock your Android device:

**Step 1:** Initiating Safe Mode requires a simultaneous three-second press of the "Volume Down" and "Power" keys. When the power menu becomes visible, proceed to long-press the "Power Off" icon.

**Step 2:** In a moment, you'll see the option "Safe Mode" replacing the other "Power Off" menu options. Proceed to boot your device into Safe Mode and uninstall the troublesome application.
