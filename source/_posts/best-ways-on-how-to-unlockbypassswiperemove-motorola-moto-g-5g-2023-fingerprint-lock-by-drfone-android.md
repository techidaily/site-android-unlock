## How To Change Motorola Moto G 5G (2023) Lock Screen Password?

Setting up a lock screen is a crucial step in protecting your phone's data. If you're not sure how to create one on your Android™ phone, we're here to help.

Your Android lock screen pin or password and your Google Account password are two passwords you use frequently. Keeping a good lock screen passcode is important.

Although you might not frequently enter your lock screen pin or password if you use a biometric unlocking method like fingerprint or facial recognition, it's still important to be familiar with it.

You'll need to reset your Google Account password if you forget it or become locked out for some other reason when you try to keep accessing all of your data. You might also need to change lock screen passcode from time to time.

## Part 1: How To Track Your Motorola Moto G 5G (2023) on Google Earth

This **Google Maps IMEI number tracking** issue has caused quite a buzz and controversy on the internet. It has raised many concerns regarding the safety and privacy of every smartphone user. To tell you the truth, Google Earth lacks IMEI location data and does not provide such capabilities. Thus, there is no truth in **tracking IMEI numbers through Google Earth**.

Many current smartphones include GPS receivers that allow them to pinpoint their exact location. If you know the phone's GPS coordinates, you can plug them into Google Earth to see where it is on the map.

- **Step 1:** This process won't be possible if your location services are not enabled on your phone. To do this, navigate to **Settings,** then **Location** on Android, and **Settings** > **Privacy** > **Location Services** on iOS.

### Pros and Cons of IMEI Trackers: Apps and Online Platforms

Now that you know there are still methods to track a phone using an IMEI number, it's also important to weigh their pros and cons. See the list presented below:

**Pros**

Check out the advantages of using IMEI trackers below:

- **Lost or Stolen Device Recovery.**The primary benefit of an IMEI tracker is its ability to help locate a lost or stolen mobile device. That can be crucial for recovering your valuable device.
- **No Need for Special Apps.**Unlike many other tracking methods, IMEI tracking doesn't require any special apps or software to be installed on the Motorola Moto G 5G (2023) device you want to track. It relies on the unique IMEI number of the Motorola Moto G 5G (2023) device.
- IMEI Tracker is compatible with many mobile devices, including smartphones and feature phones. It's not limited to a specific operating system or brand.

**Cons**

Below are the drawbacks of using IMEI trackers:

- **Internet and Network Dependency.**IMEI tracking depends on the Motorola Moto G 5G (2023) device being connected to the internet or a mobile network. If the Motorola Moto G 5G (2023) device is turned off, in airplane mode, or disconnected, tracking may be impossible.
- **Inaccuracies in Remote Areas.**IMEI tracking can be less accurate or even unavailable in remote or rural areas with poor network coverage.

In summary, an IMEI tracker can be a valuable tool for locating lost or stolen mobile devices with its location accuracy and compatibility with various devices. However, it comes with limitations related to privacy and network dependency.
