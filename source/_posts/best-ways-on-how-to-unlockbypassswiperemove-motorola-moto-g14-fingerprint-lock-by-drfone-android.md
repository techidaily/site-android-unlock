It is imperative to understand that unlocking your Motorola Moto G14  Phone using a Gmail ID and password should be your last resort and especially if you are using an older version of Android.

Some users focus on privacy and feel uncomfortable with Google Smart Lock's access to their passwords. The reason behind this is how easily anyone can access the saved password.
