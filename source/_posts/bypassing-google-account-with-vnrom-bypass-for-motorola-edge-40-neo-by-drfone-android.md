- **Step 1:** Open the Phone app and dial \*#06# on your Motorola. This will display your phone’s IMEI number. Note this number down for future reference.
- **Step 2:** Call your carrier and request a SIM unlock code. You’ll likely need to provide your Motorola’s IMEI number.
- **Step 3:** If you meet your carrier’s requirements, they will email you the SIM unlock code within 2-5 days.
- **Step 4:** Once you receive the code, replace your current SIM with one from a different carrier. When prompted, enter the SIM unlock code you received via email.

### Alternative Method: Android SIM Unlock

If your carrier cannot unlock your Motorola Edge 40 Neo  ’s SIM, or if you prefer a quicker solution, consider using network unlocking services. This may be websites like UnlockBase, Mobile Unlocks, etc.

This generally involves the following steps:

- **Step 1**: Like the previous method, retrieve your IMEI number by dialing \*#06# on your Pixel.
- **Step 2:** Go to the Android SIM unlock provider’s website and enter your device’s IMEI number.
- **Step 3:** Follow through with the checkout process, providing payment and contact information.
- **Step 4:** Once the payment is processed, you’ll receive the unlock code via SMS or email. Insert a SIM from a different carrier into your Pixel, then enter the received [<u>unlock code</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/samsung-unlock-codes.html) when prompted.
