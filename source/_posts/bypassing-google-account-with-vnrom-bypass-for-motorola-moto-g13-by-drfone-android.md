You will be prompted to enter the current PIN in order to disable it. Key in the PIN and you will have successfully disabled the Lock screen PIN. When you power off and the power on your android device, you will easily access your phone without any need for security PIN. Similarly, anyone can use your phone if they can gain access to it as it doesn't have any screen lock.

Enabling screen lock on your Android is the smartest thing to do especially if you value your own privacy. On the other hand, it is a nightmare if you forget screen lock and you don't know how to go about it. But at this moment, at least you have known a perfect way that you can remove screen lock without losing data on your Android phone.
