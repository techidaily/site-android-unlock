Overall, this method consumes a lot of time.

**Step 1:** Go to Settings > Backup & Reset.

**Step 2:** Tap Factory Reset > Reset Phone.

**Step 3:** Tap Erase Everything.

## Method 4: Use Google Find My Device To Unlock Oppo A38  Phones (Wipes User Data)

Using Find My Device, you can play a sound on the Oppo A38 device to locate it in the house if you have misplaced it, lock the phone in case it is lost, and wipe the Oppo A38 device remotely.

**Step 1:** Go to <https://accounts.google.com>.
