## How to Unlock a Network Locked Sony Xperia 10 V Phone?

## Part 1: What Does It Mean When Your Sony Xperia 10 V Phone is Network Locked?

In the simplest words, a network-locked Sony Xperia 10 V phone means that your device has become carrier-specific. It will now work only with the network provider from where the phone was purchased.

### 2\. Is it legal to unlock it?

Unlocking your network-locked phone is legal in every sense. It is however advisable to contact your service provider for addressing the concern. The only downside of unlocking such phones is the loss of device warranty assured at the time of purchase.
