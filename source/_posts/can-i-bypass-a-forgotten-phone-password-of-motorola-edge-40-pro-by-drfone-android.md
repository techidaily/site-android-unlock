You can perform this method if you have your Google account credentials and are ready. However, we want you to back up your data so you can sign once more after the reset and restore a ton of your data.

Since you're locked out, you will have to utilize a technique to do the reset. The most straightforward way is to utilize Google's Find My Device site. So, if the Find my Device option feature is enabled on your phone, you can tap the **Erase device** choice on this page to reset it.

If you can't use the Find my device feature, you'll have to factory reset physically. To do as such:

- Power your device off.

- Press the Volume down button two times to feature the Recovery Mode choice. Then, at that point, press the power button to choose it.
