## Part 2: 4 Simple Ways to Bypass Your Vivo T2 Pro 5G Phone Password

### 1\. Google Find My Device

Our first approach to unlocking your device is to do a factory reset. That erases every one of the data on your phone too. You can perform this method if you have your Google account credentials and are ready. However, we want you to back up your data so you can sign once more after the reset and restore a ton of your data.

Since you're locked out, you will have to utilize a technique to do the reset. The most straightforward way is to utilize Google's Find My Device site. So, if the Find my Device option feature is enabled on your phone, you can tap the **Erase device** choice on this page to reset it.

### 2\. Enter Recovery Mode to Hard Reset

If you can't use the Find my device feature, you'll have to factory reset physically. To do as such:

- Power your device off.
- Hold the Volume (-) and power keys all the while after the screen goes dark to raise Android's bootloader menu. This button blend might be different relying on your device model.
- Press the Volume down button two times to feature the Recovery Mode choice. Then, at that point, press the power button to choose it.
- Hold the power button and press the Volume up button to enter this mode.
- Utilize the volume buttons to go to the Wipe data/Factory Reset choice. Continue with the steps to play out a factory reset.

### 3\. Use ADB

This fix isn't guaranteed to work; if you don't watch out, it could damage your phone. Therefore, we suggest you back up everything on your Android before proceeding.

If your phone has USB debugging enabled, is connected to a PC, and is not encrypted, follow these steps:

- Connect your device to your PC through a USB connector.
- Open Command Prompt or Terminal window to your ADB installation registry.
- Type in adb shell rm/data/system/gesture.key and click the Enter key.
- Reboot your phone. When you do, the solid lock screen ought to be gone.
- That is not a permanent condition, so reset your PIN or password lock before you reboot your device once more. That's how you reset **password for phone.**

## How to Remove Operator Lock on Vivo T2 Pro 5G ?

An operator lock, also called a carrier lock, constitutes a limitation imposed on a mobile phone by a network provider. This measure is implemented to guarantee that the Vivo T2 Pro 5G device exclusively functions with the services provided by that specific carrier. If you wish to remove the operator lock from your Vivo T2 Pro 5G  device, you'll need to follow specific steps and meet certain criteria. Here's how to remove the operator lock on a Vivo T2 Pro 5G :

**Step 1:** Begin by checking whether your device can be unlocked or not from its network carrier restrictions. To do that, you need to dial the code “\*#\*#7378423#\*#\*” on your device, tap “Service Info” and select “SIM Lock.”

![dial the provided number](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/10/unlock-sony-xperia-pin-code-5.jpg)

**Step 2:** Carefully check the information provided on the screen. If there is "X" before the "Network" option and the number in front of it is larger than 0, it means your device can be unlocked. If the number in front of "Network" is 0, your device can't be unlocked as it is hard-locked.

![check the network status](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/10/unlock-sony-xperia-pin-code-6.jpg)

**Step 3:** The next step involves getting your device’s IMEI number. To accomplish this task, simply input "\*#06#" on your device. Once you have the IMEI number, use a reliable service from the internet to the unlocking code. Insert the SIM card of another network and provide the code you gained to unlock your Vivo T2 Pro 5G  device.

## Bonus Tip: How to Unlock Bootloader?

Unlocking the bootloader on your Android device provides significant advantages. These actions encompass obtaining root access, installing custom ROMs, configuring custom recoveries, and carrying out advanced procedures. Here's an essential guide on unlocking the bootloader of your Sony device while keeping all precautions in mind:

**Step 1:** To start with the process, verify the bootloader status for your Sony smartphone. On opening the "Dialer" app, dial the number "\*#\*#7378423#\*#\*" and access the "Rooting Status" option within the "Service Provider" settings.

**Step 2:** If the bootloader status displays "Yes," ensure that the Sony USB drivers and ADB tools are installed on your computer. Enable "USB Debugging" and "OEM Unlocking" on your smartphone and switch it off.

**Step 3:** Connect the Vivo T2 Pro 5G  smartphone with a USB cable and press the "Power + Volume Up" keys for a few seconds. Open the Windows computer and access the "Devices and Printers" directory. Right-click on the "fastboot driver" file, select "Update," and select the location of the "android\_winbus.inf" file. Verify the fastboot connectivity through the CMD command.

**Step 4:** Open the official “Sony Unlocking Site” and add in the IMEI number. On acknowledging, use the commands as follows: `adb reboot bootloader`

Unlock the bootloader with the following command: `fastboot oem unlock 0x<insert your unlock code`

Verify the bootloader is unlocked and use the command to reboot the system; if not done automatically: `fastboot reboot`

## Conclusion

Forgetting your Vivo T2 Pro 5G  screen unlock password, PIN, or pattern is quite common. For such instances, there are several methods that you can use to unlock your screen, 5 of which we have discussed in this article.

If you’re looking for ways that are time-effective and reliable, you can use your Google account or other ways to unlock Vivo T2 Pro 5G  and set a new screen lock. However, with these methods, you can lose your data, so we only recommend using them if your device is backed up.

## 7.Next Lock Screen

Next Lock Screen is a cross platform unlock app that's compatible with the complete Android ecosystem, making it one of the most valuable unlock apps for Android on the market.

The home screen will highlight notifications for which it will offer two options, either you swipe down in which case you will ignore the notification, or swipe anywhere else and the lock screen will unlock. What's really great about this Android unlock app is the fact that it can use your device's sensors, allowing it to detect its placement therefore whether or not it should be on or off.
