## Forgot Pattern Lock? Here's How You Can Unlock Motorola Moto G14 Pattern Lock Screen

Forgetting the pattern lock of a device and getting locked out of it is probably one of the most frustrating scenarios faced by Android users. Nevertheless, unlike popular operating systems, Android provides a seamless way to past the forgot pattern lock feature.

You can either try Google’s native solution or a third-party tool in case you have forgotten the pattern lock on your device and reset it.

Nevertheless, if your device hasn’t been updated and you are using an Android 4.4 or previous version, then you can bypass the forgot pattern lock by following these steps:

**Step 1.** Firstly, provide the wrong pattern to your device. It will let you know that you applied the incorrect pattern.

An alternative method to modify the **Android lock screen clock** involves activating Android’s screen saver. There are options where it’s more pleasing than the default lock screen clock. If you want to **change the lock screen clock**, follow the steps.

- **Step 1:** Open the **Clock** app and tap the **three dots** in the upper-right corner. Select **Screensaver** and toggle it on.

![screensaver and new lock screen clock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/change-lock-screen-clock-07.jpg)

- **Step 2**: If you want to customize the screensaver clock’s appearance, go to **Settings** > **Display** > **Screensaver.** Choose analog, digital, or night mode.

### Method 5: Keep Unread Notifications

To avoid adjusting your Android device settings, you can make the lock screen clock smaller by maintaining unread notifications. The clock occupies less space when there are unread notifications. It shifts back to the top-left corner when you receive a new notification. Simply leave notifications unread to keep the clock smaller.

### Bonus

For users who prefer not to have a lock screen clock, follow these steps:

- **Step 1**: Open **Settings** > **Lock screen** or **Security & lock screen**.
- **Step 2**: Look for **Clock and FaceWidgets** or a similar option. Disable or toggle off the **Clock** or **Show clock** setting. Save changes, and your lock screen should no longer display the clock.

## Part 3. An Exception: Change the Lock Screen Clock on Samsung Phones

- **Step 1:** Go to **Settings** > **Lock screen** or **Lock screen & security**. Choose **Customize lock screen** > **Clock**, **Clock** **style,** or **Lock screen clock**.

![customizing lock screen clock on samsung](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/change-lock-screen-clock-09.jpg)

- **Step 2:** Choose between different styles, such as digital, analog, or others. Some Samsung models offer extra settings like color, size, and more to enhance your lock screen further. Select the one that suits your taste.

If you’d rather remove the lock screen clock on your Samsung device, follow these steps:

- **Step 1**: Go to **Settings** > **Lock screen** or **Lock screen & security**.Choose **Customize lock screen** > **Clock**, **Clock** **style,** or **Lock screen clock**.
- **Step 2**: Disable or toggle off this setting to remove the clock from your lock screen.
