### 4: Hard Reset (data loss)

A hard reset would be the best solution if you forgot your phone's lock screen password or pattern. However, you can unlock your phone with your Google account as well.

Here are the steps for **Samsung Galaxy S24  pattern unlock without a PC** through a hard reset.

- Switch off your Samsung Galaxy S24  with the power button.
