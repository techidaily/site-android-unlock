PRECAUTION:  At best, this can be the first level of security, as one who resembles you to some extent can unlock the Vivo T2x 5G device. Photographs are not stored in the system. The device does hold necessary data to recognize your face, and the security level is determined by how good the Vivo T2x 5G device is configured. The data is not accessed by any app or loaded onto a Google server for backup.
