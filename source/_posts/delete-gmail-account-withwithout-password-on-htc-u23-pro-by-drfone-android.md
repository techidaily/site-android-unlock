## Part 1: Lock System About HTC U23 Pro  

### 1: Lock Types

Before we move towards the **HTC U23 Pro  pattern unlock**, let's talk about its lock types and security system.

- Select the "Lockscreen Password" option at the top and tap on the "Enable Lock Screen" button.
- Select the type of lock you want to set and create a password.

### 4: Hard Reset (data loss)

A hard reset would be the best solution if you forgot your phone's lock screen password or pattern. However, you can unlock your phone with your Google account as well. Do a hard reset if you can't remember your Google account password and don't want to use third-party tools. The only problem with hard resetting is that you lose all your data, images, files, settings, and personalization. That is why you can't recover any of your data after the hard reset if you don't have a data backup. The process of hard reset is different for every device. Here are the steps for **HTC U23 Pro  pattern unlock without a PC** through a hard reset.

- Switch off your HTC U23 Pro  with the power button.
