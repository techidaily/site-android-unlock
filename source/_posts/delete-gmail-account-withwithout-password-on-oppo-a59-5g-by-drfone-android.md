Android Lollipop added a feature called Smart Lock, and the feature was devised as a smart tool to prevent the Android phone from locking once it was initially unlocked. In other words, the feature overrides an Android phone's Lock Screen feature, thereby saving users the need to enter passwords every time the Oppo A59 5G device locks.

If you're at home, it's likely your android phone is locked out if you haven't accessed at for some time. Smart Locks solves the problem in many ways. It allows you to allocate trusted places. Once you within range of the trusted places, your phone won't lock. Trusted devices come next. Smart Lock is assigned to Bluetooth and Android NFC unlock devices.

![smart lock android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14555207782388.jpg)

The feature recognizes your face and then unlocks the Oppo A59 5G device. Once you set up the Oppo A59 5G device to recognize your face as a trusted face, it will unlock the Oppo A59 5G device as soon as it recognizes you.

![smart lock android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14555208588486.jpg)

PRECAUTION:  At best, this can be the first level of security, as one who resembles you to some extent can unlock the Oppo A59 5G device. Photographs are not stored in the system. The device does hold necessary data to recognize your face, and the security level is determined by how good the Oppo A59 5G device is configured. The data is not accessed by any app or loaded onto a Google server for backup.

_Setting Up Trusted Face_

- • Go to Smart Lock and tap Trusted Face.
- • Tap on Setup. Follow on-screen instructions.

![smart lock android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14555210728317.jpg)

![smart lock android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14555211623749.jpg)

In case Trusted Face is not required, tap on reset Trusted Face appearing under the Trusted Face menu. Tap on Reset to reset the option.

_How To Improve Facial Recognition In Your Bluetooth and Android NFC Unlock Devices_

![smart lock android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14555212902436.jpg)

## Rootjunky APK To Bypass Google FRP Lock For Oppo A59 5G 

Factory Reset Protection (FRP) is a security feature built into Android devices running Android 5.1 Lollipop and later versions. It prevents someone from using your phone after a factory data reset without Google account login credentials. The FRP makes it much less attractive for thieves to steal Android phones, knowing they will need help to access them.

FRP automatically activates when you add a Google account to your Android phone. It links the Oppo A59 5G device to your account, making it the “trusted owner.” Once activated, FRP becomes embedded in the phone’s system.

While Google FRP is a valuable security feature, it’s vital to acknowledge that there are legitimate situations where bypassing it might be necessary. These instances include forgotten Google account credentials, buying a second-hand device, and device issues. In these cases, tools like **RootJunky** can help you [<u>bypass FRP Lock</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/google-frp-unlock/bypass-frp-with-computer.html). We’ll explore how to use **RootJunky APK** later, but first, let’s define what it is and its role in FRP bypass.

![holding an android smartphone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/rootjunky-01.jpg)


The **RootJunky APK** is a free Android application also called RootJunky SDL or **RootJunky FRP** Bypass tool. This app’s primary function is to bypass the Google Account FRP lock on Samsung devices. Rootjunky uses the weaknesses in Android’s setup process to create a new user account or switch existing ones, letting you bypass the FRP and regain control of your phone.

You can complete this process using the app by connecting your phone to a computer through an OTG cable. **RootJunky** can be helpfu l if you’ve forgotten your Google account password or bought a second-hand phone locked to someone else’s account. However, only use it if you have legitimate reasons to bypass FRP lock, like accessing your device after forgetting your Google account details.

![rootjunky logo](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/rootjunky-02.jpg)

Downloading the **RootJunky FRP** bypass tool from unofficial sources can introduce malware risks, so stick to trusted sources like the official website. Additionally, when exploring RootJunky, it is vital to keep the following in mind:

- Bypassing FRP may involve data loss.
- Download **RootJunky FRP** bypass APK from a reliable source to minimize the risk of malware or viruses. You can check the APK file from official websites or trusted forums.
- Google constantly updates its security measures, so these tools may not always work effectively.
