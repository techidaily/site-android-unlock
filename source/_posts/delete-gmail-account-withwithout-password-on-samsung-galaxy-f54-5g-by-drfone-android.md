![smart lock android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14555162221345.jpg)

Android Lollipop added a feature called Smart Lock, and the feature was devised as a smart tool to prevent the Android phone from locking once it was initially unlocked. In other words, the feature overrides an Android phone's Lock Screen feature, thereby saving users the need to enter passwords every time the Samsung Galaxy F54 5G device locks.

If you're at home, it's likely your android phone is locked out if you haven't accessed at for some time. Smart Locks solves the problem in many ways. It allows you to allocate trusted places. Once you within range of the trusted places, your phone won't lock. Trusted devices come next. Smart Lock is assigned to Bluetooth and Android NFC unlock devices.

**Step 4:** Press the settings choice on your Android gadget after pulling down the notification tray. Now you will have the chance to enter the PIN/password, and you ought to continue unlocking your Android phone. Continue to paste until the lock screen UI crashes.

### 4\. Safe Mode Boot (For Android 4.1 or later)

**Step 1:** You can bring up the power menu and hold the "Power Off" button for most phones, especially Android phones. A warning will spring up, asking whether you might want to Reboot to Safe Mode. Here, it would help if you had to press Ok.

**Step 2:** Clear your lock screen application's data.

Clean data off your lock screen app, uninstall it, and then reboot your device to escape safe mode. When you do so, your phone or Android device will unlock.

### 5\. Use ADB (USB required for Android 10 and lower)

- Connect your device to your PC using a USB connector.
- On your PC, open a terminal window (or command prompt).
- Type in the commands given below. Press Enter after each line:

adb shell

album/data/data/com.android.providers.settings/databases

sqlite3 settings.db

update system set value=0 where name='lock\_pattern\_autolock';

update system set value=0 where name='lockscreen.lockedoutpermanently';

.quit

exit

adb reboot

- After your gadget has rebooted, enter the command below:

adb shell

rm/data/framework/gesture.key

exit

adb reboot

- Your phone will reboot. After it reboots and requests a security pattern, you can utilize any pattern, and it will unlock.
