## How to Unlock a Network Locked Oppo A18 Phone?

Revolutions in the telecommunication industry have introduced advancements in smartphone features and utilities. The other side of the coin is, however, not as appealing. Thanks to the different carrier services, network locking is the commonest issue of recent mobile launches. Users have reported of Oppo A18 phones refusing to work with different carriers.

The issue limits the smartphone's functioning to the specific carrier from whom the Oppo A18 device is purchased. Consequently, there are annoying connectivity problems that restrict seamless mobile usage. The problem aggravates in geo-restricted regions where the carrier options are quite limited. This scenario puts forward the need for **Oppo A18 network unlock** solutions.

## Part 1: What Does It Mean When Your Oppo A18 Phone is Network Locked?

In the simplest words, a network-locked Oppo A18 phone means that your device has become carrier-specific. It will now work only with the network provider from where the phone was purchased.

## Part 1: How to set up Pattern Lock Screen on Oppo A18?

Out of all the provided options for screen locks, pattern lock is mostly used due to its ease of access and added security. If you haven’t set up a screen lock pattern on your device, then we recommend you to do the same right away. Not only will it keep intruders away, it will also protect your privacy. To learn how to set up a lock screen pattern on an Android device, simply follow these steps:

- 1\. Firstly, unlock your device and go to its Settings. You can access it from the Home Screen or from its Notification Center.
- 2\. Under the personal or privacy section, you can access the “Lock Screen and Security” option.
- 3\. In some versions, the option is also listed right at the top of the settings (in its quick access).

![setup android pattern lock screen-unlock your device](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/09/15057378431872.jpg) ![setup android pattern lock screen-Under the personal or privacy section](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/09/15057378838236.jpg) ![setup android pattern lock screen-access Lock Screen and Security](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/09/15057379016188.jpg)

- 4\. To set up a pattern lock screen, tap on the “Screen lock type” feature.
- 5\. This will provide a list of all the different kinds of locks that you can apply. Ideally, it would be password, pin, pattern, swipe, or none. In “Swipe”, you can unlock a device just by swiping the screen. Whereas, in pattern, pin, or password, you would be needed to provide the respective pattern/pin/password to unlock the Oppo A18 device.
- 6\. We recommend setting up a lock screen pattern instead. To do this, tap on the “Pattern” option.

- 7\. From the next screen, you can simply draw any kind of pattern of your choice. Ideally, it should join at least 4 dots on the screen. We recommend using a strong screen lock pattern to provide unmatched security to your device.
- 8\. Furthermore, you need to confirm your choice and provide the same pattern once again. Make sure that you draw the same pattern here.
- 9\. Additionally, the interface will ask you to provide a security pin as well. In case if you will forget your pattern, then you can access your phone by taking the assistance of this pin.
