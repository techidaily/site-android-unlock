![android lock screen settings](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/android-lock-screen-settings-3.jpg)

Keep your any finger on the middle of the round charm and by keeping your finger pressed, reach on the lock icon. The lock screen will be unlocked just after reaching your finger to the lock icon.

### 2.Face Unlock

This method of unlocking your lock screen needs your Android device to snap a photo of your with its camera. After you set the snapped photo as the unlocking recognition, you could unlock your device through showing your face on the screen.

Capture a picture of your face with your Android device's camera and then set it for logging in into your device. From the lock screen, by just by holding your face, you can log in. It's very interesting, but you should never rely on this method for strong security as this method of unlocking is prone to break easily as an intruder can unlock your device by putting a photo of you in front of your device. Moreover, this method sometimes doesn't work properly. So it's better to go for some other highly secured options for locking your screen.

### 3.Pattern

This is a way of setting pattern for lock screen from a grid of nine dots. You can select the pattern like some letter like Z, L or C etc, but nothing guarantees high security as the set pattern can be easily guessed or be seen while you are unlocking your device. Another problem is that by unlocking with the same pattern, your finger leaves some marks for the pattern's path. By following the path, a stranger can unlock your device. So for little security, you can use pattern unlock method on your Android device.
