## Part 1: How to bypass forgot pattern lock using the 'Forgot Pattern' feature?

One of the easiest and fastest ways to fix the forgot pattern lock issue on a device is by using its inbuilt “Forgot Pattern” feature. If you are using an Android 4.4 or earlier version, then you can simply access this feature. Since users can hack an Android device just by knowing the Google credentials of the connected device, the solution was later discontinued (as it was considered a security vulnerability). Nevertheless, if your device hasn’t been updated and you are using an Android 4.4 or previous version, then you can bypass the forgot pattern lock by following these steps:

**Step 1.** Firstly, provide the wrong pattern to your device. It will let you know that you applied the incorrect pattern.

**Step 2.** On the same prompt, you can see an option of “Forgot pattern” on the bottom. Simply tap on it.

## Part 2: How to get past forgot pattern lock using Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (Android)?

One of the major drawbacks of the “Forgot pattern” feature is that it doesn’t work on new Android devices. Since most of the Lava Blaze 2 5G devices out there have been updated, the technique has been outdated. Therefore, you can simply take the assistance of [Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (Android)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare-dr-fone-unlock-android-screen/) to bypass the forgot pattern lock on your device. Without causing any harm to your device or erasing its data, your device’s password or pattern would be removed.

It is a part of the Dr.Fone toolkit and is compatible with all the leading Android devices out there. It can be used to remove passwords, patterns, pins, and more. It has an easy-to-use interface and provides a simple click-through process to resolve the forgot pattern Android lock on your device. However, this tool merely retains all the data after unlocking Samsung and LG screens. Other Android locked screens can also be unlocked, and the only thing is that it will wipe all the data after unlocking.
