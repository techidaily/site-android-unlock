## Part 1: How to bypass forgot pattern lock using the 'Forgot Pattern' feature?

One of the easiest and fastest ways to fix the forgot pattern lock issue on a device is by using its inbuilt “Forgot Pattern” feature. If you are using an Android 4.4 or earlier version, then you can simply access this feature. Since users can hack an Android device just by knowing the Google credentials of the connected device, the solution was later discontinued (as it was considered a security vulnerability). Nevertheless, if your device hasn’t been updated and you are using an Android 4.4 or previous version, then you can bypass the forgot pattern lock by following these steps:

**Step 1.** Firstly, provide the wrong pattern to your device. It will let you know that you applied the incorrect pattern.

**Step 2.** On the same prompt, you can see an option of “Forgot pattern” on the bottom. Simply tap on it.

**Step 4.** To reset the forgot pattern lock, you need to provide the correct Google credentials of the account already linked to the Oppo A2 device.

### 2\. Cross-Platform Synchronization

It synchronizes saved passwords across multiple devices using the same Google account. This ensures smooth access to credentials on Android devices and computers.

### 3\. Secure Storage

Passwords stored within Google Smart Lock are encrypted and securely stored in the user's Google account. This maintains confidentiality and safeguards sensitive login information.
