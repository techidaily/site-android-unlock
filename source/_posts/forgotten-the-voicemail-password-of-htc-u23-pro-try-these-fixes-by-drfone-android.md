## Part 2: FAQs

### 1\. How To Know My Default Voicemail Password?

Depending on your carrier, the default voicemail password is either the last seven or final four digits of your phone number. Your voicemails should be accessible if you dial the number without the area code. In this way, you can quickly get your default voicemail password.

### 2\. Can I Remove My Voicemail Password?

From your mobile device, dial 123 to see the password for your voicemail. To enable (add) or disable (delete) your voicemail password, choose option 4. To enable or disable the screen password, select option 1. If your password has been deactivated, dialing 123 will not ask you to enter one.

### 3\. How Can I Receive Voicemail Messages From Another Device?

You may access your mailbox on another phone if your phone is out of reach or the battery is dead. Make a call to your phone number from a different one. Tap the pound key (#) on the phone's dial pad after the prerecorded "Please leave a message" greeting has begun to play. Enter the pin from your voicemail to start receiving messages from another device.

This process involves using a WiFi analyzer app to scan for nearby wireless networks, analyze their signal strength, and identify potential vulnerabilities. The app then attempts to exploit these weaknesses and gain access to the network's password. While this approach may seem like an easy way to access a password-protected WiFi network, it is important to note that hacking into someone else's network without their permission is illegal and can lead to serious legal consequences.

**Steps to usage:**

![wifi inspector](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/wifi-analyzer-2.jpg)

- **Step 1.** Download and install WiFi Analyzer app from Google Play Store.
- **Step 2.** Open the app and scan for available WiFi networks.
- **Step 3.** Select the target network and note down its channel and signal strength.
- **Step 4.** Open a terminal emulator app on your Android device and enter the command "airodump-ng wlan0" to start capturing packets.
- **Step 5.** Once enough packets are captured, enter the command "aircrack-ng -w \[path to wordlist\] -b \[target BSSID\] \[path to capture file\]" to crack the password.
- **Step 6.** The password will be displayed on the screen once it is successfully cracked.li>

**Pros:**

- Easy to use and user-friendly interface.
- Can help identify weak spots in your own WiFi network.
- Can reveal other WiFi networks in the area and their strength.

**Cons:**

- Illegal and unethical to use to hack into someone else's WiFi network without their permission.
- Can be unreliable and not always effective in cracking passwords.
- Can potentially harm your own device's security.

**Key User Review:** Great tool for finding out what's on your WiFi. If only I could get rid of those rotten ads!
