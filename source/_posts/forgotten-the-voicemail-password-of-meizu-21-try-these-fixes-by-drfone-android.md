![voicemail](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/how-to-reset-voicemail-password-on-android-1.jpg)

### 1\. Contact your carrier

Your carrier can also unlock your voicemail. Get in touch with your carrier and ask for an unlock. For unlocking, your account may need to satisfy certain conditions. The request can take a few days to be processed after you submit it.

Get in touch with your carrier to find out the status of your unlock request.

The actions following should be followed when your carrier certifies that the voicemail has been reset.

- Take your SIM card out.
- Put the new SIM card in. Your gadget will turn on, and you will be able to generate a new voicemail password.

### 2\. Use your code to reset password

To change your Voicemail password, use star codes. Fortunately, this process is quick and easy, and you won't need to contact customer care to change your password.

Use the star code as follows:

- Type #793# into the dialer app on your phone.
- Press the Call key.
- Await the instructions.

This will change your voicemail password to your phone's last four digits.

You can also reset your voicemail password, which means that you can generate a new code by resetting it from the settings. Let's have a look at how you can do this.

- Select the Meizu 21 device you wish to manage by scrolling to My Devices & Add-ons.

## Part 2: FAQs

### 1\. How To Know My Default Voicemail Password?

Depending on your carrier, the default voicemail password is either the last seven or final four digits of your phone number. Your voicemails should be accessible if you dial the number without the area code. In this way, you can quickly get your default voicemail password.

### 2\. Can I Remove My Voicemail Password?

From your mobile device, dial 123 to see the password for your voicemail. To enable (add) or disable (delete) your voicemail password, choose option 4. To enable or disable the screen password, select option 1. If your password has been deactivated, dialing 123 will not ask you to enter one.

### 3\. How Can I Receive Voicemail Messages From Another Device?

You may access your mailbox on another phone if your phone is out of reach or the battery is dead. Make a call to your phone number from a different one. Tap the pound key (#) on the phone's dial pad after the prerecorded "Please leave a message" greeting has begun to play. Enter the pin from your voicemail to start receiving messages from another device.
