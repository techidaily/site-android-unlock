![voicemail](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/how-to-reset-voicemail-password-on-android-1.jpg)

### 1\. Contact your carrier

Your carrier can also unlock your voicemail. Get in touch with your carrier and ask for an unlock. For unlocking, your account may need to satisfy certain conditions. The request can take a few days to be processed after you submit it.

Get in touch with your carrier to find out the status of your unlock request.

The actions following should be followed when your carrier certifies that the voicemail has been reset.

- Take your SIM card out.
- Put the new SIM card in. Your gadget will turn on, and you will be able to generate a new voicemail password.

### 2\. Use your code to reset password

To change your Voicemail password, use star codes. Fortunately, this process is quick and easy, and you won't need to contact customer care to change your password.

Use the star code as follows:

- Type #793# into the dialer app on your phone.
- Press the Call key.
- Await the instructions.

This will change your voicemail password to your phone's last four digits.

You can also reset your voicemail password, which means that you can generate a new code by resetting it from the settings. Let's have a look at how you can do this.

- Select the Vivo X100 Pro device you wish to manage by scrolling to My Devices & Add-ons.
- Choosing Manage my device.
- Look under Device choices & settings, choose Reset voicemail password, then adhere to the on-screen instructions.

## Part 2: FAQs

### 1\. How To Know My Default Voicemail Password?

Depending on your carrier, the default voicemail password is either the last seven or final four digits of your phone number. Your voicemails should be accessible if you dial the number without the area code. In this way, you can quickly get your default voicemail password.

### 2\. Can I Remove My Voicemail Password?

From your mobile device, dial 123 to see the password for your voicemail. To enable (add) or disable (delete) your voicemail password, choose option 4. To enable or disable the screen password, select option 1. If your password has been deactivated, dialing 123 will not ask you to enter one.

### 3\. How Can I Receive Voicemail Messages From Another Device?

You may access your mailbox on another phone if your phone is out of reach or the battery is dead. Make a call to your phone number from a different one. Tap the pound key (#) on the phone's dial pad after the prerecorded "Please leave a message" greeting has begun to play.

## Rootjunky APK To Bypass Google FRP Lock For Vivo X100 Pro 

Factory Reset Protection (FRP) is a security feature built into Android devices running Android 5.1 Lollipop and later versions. It prevents someone from using your phone after a factory data reset without Google account login credentials. The FRP makes it much less attractive for thieves to steal Android phones, knowing they will need help to access them.

FRP automatically activates when you add a Google account to your Android phone. It links the Vivo X100 Pro device to your account, making it the “trusted owner.” Once activated, FRP becomes embedded in the phone’s system.

While Google FRP is a valuable security feature, it’s vital to acknowledge that there are legitimate situations where bypassing it might be necessary. These instances include forgotten Google account credentials, buying a second-hand device, and device issues. In these cases, tools like **RootJunky** can help you [<u>bypass FRP Lock</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/google-frp-unlock/bypass-frp-with-computer.html).

You can complete this process using the app by connecting your phone to a computer through an OTG cable. **RootJunky** can be helpfu l if you’ve forgotten your Google account password or bought a second-hand phone locked to someone else’s account. However, only use it if you have legitimate reasons to bypass FRP lock, like accessing your device after forgetting your Google account details.

![rootjunky logo](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/rootjunky-02.jpg)
