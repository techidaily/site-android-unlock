## Part 1: Lock System About Vivo T2 Pro 5G  

### 1: Lock Types

Before we move towards the **Vivo T2 Pro 5G  pattern unlock**, let's talk about its lock types and security system. Vivo T2 Pro 5G  is one of the older versions of Vivo  android phones that was released in 2016. At that time, only flagship phones from each brand came with features like fingerprint sensors and facial unlock. Vivo T2 Pro 5G  doesn't offer these lock types. You can only set up a screen lock as a password, pattern, and PIN. You can also lock apps on Vivo T2 Pro 5G  with its privacy password settings.

### 2: How to Set Them up?

Follow these steps to set up any type of lock on your Vivo T2 Pro 5G  .

- Open “Settings” on your mobile and select "Lockscreen and Password".
- The lock system menu would appear if your device had no screen locks. If your device has a screen lock, you will have to enter the password to enter the settings.
- Select the "Lockscreen Password" option at the top and tap on the "Enable Lock Screen" button.
- Select the type of lock you want to set and create a password.

### 3: How to Remove Them with Password or Pattern?

Here are the steps for **Vivo T2 Pro 5G  pattern unlock without a PC** through a hard reset.
