Open Dr.Fone on your PC, then select "Phone Backup" from the menu.

Next, join your Android phone to the computer with a USB cable. The phone must be in USB debugging mode, please. You will be prompted to approve USB Debugging in a pop-up window on the Android phone if your version of Android is higher. Press the OK button if you would.

Click Backup to start backing up the data on your Android device.

If you have previously used this programme to back up your device, you may review your backup history by clicking on "View backup history."

**Step 2:** Choose which file types to backup.

Once the Android phone is connected, select the file types you want to backup. Dr. Fone has previously examined all the file types for you. After that, click Backup to start the backup process.

It will cost some time for the backup. Do not disconnect your Android phone from the computer, use it, or delete any data while making a backup.
