## Wrap it up

We have discussed 3 different ways above to unlock the locked screen of android mobiles all these three methods will work for you, but there are some differences in every method. If you follow the second method which is resetting your phone then you will lose everything on your phone and [the first method](https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/locked-out-of-android-phone.html#part_1) will help you to unlock your phone screen without losing a single file from your android phone, the third way is not reliable because it doesn’t work on all android devices. So finally we can say android lock screen removal software from Wondershare is the best choice for you to unlock your phone screen when the question comes to your mind locked out my phone and how I can unlock it without losing data now.
