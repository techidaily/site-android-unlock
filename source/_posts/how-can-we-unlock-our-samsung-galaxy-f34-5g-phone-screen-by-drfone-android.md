**Step 2:** Clear data from your lock screen application, uninstall and reboot your phone to escape the Safe mode. When you do so, your Android **screen lock** will unlock.

## Part 1: Ways That Samsung Lets You Unlock Your Samsung Galaxy F34 5G

Samsung Galaxy F34 5G  are more than just smartphones; they are gateways to a personalized and secure user experience. To access the myriad of features these devices offer, Google provides several unlocking methods, ensuring both convenience and security. Here are these options:

- A Personal Identification Number (PIN) is a simple yet effective way to secure your phone. It’s a numeric code that you enter on the lock screen. Setting up a PIN is straightforward via the Samsung Galaxy F34 5G device’s security settings, and unlocking your phone is as easy as tapping in the correct sequence of numbers.
- Similar to a PIN but potentially more secure due to the allowance of a longer combination of numbers and letters. A passcode is ideal for those who seek an extra layer of security. You set it up in the security settings and use it to unlock your phone just like a PIN but with the added complexity of alphanumeric characters.
- **Face Unlock.Pixel’s Face Unlock** uses advanced facial recognition software. It scans your face to grant access, offering a hands-free and quick way to unlock your Pixel. This feature can be activated in the security settings and requires a simple glance at your phone to unlock.

![woman holding a Samsung Galaxy F34 5G](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/google-pixel-7-unlock-02.jpg)

- [**<u><b>Fingerprint Unlock</b></u>**](https://drfone.wondershare.com/google-frp-unlock/google-pixel-frp-bypass.html)**.** This method uses your unique fingerprint as a key. It’s fast, secure, and convenient. The Pixel 6a, 6, and 7 fingerprint scanners are actually under the display. Register your fingerprint in the settings, then touch the sensor to gain access.
- **Pattern**. If you prefer a more visual method, the [<u>pattern lock</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/mi-pattern-lock.html) lets you draw a specific shape or pattern on the screen to unlock your phone. It’s a fun and interactive way to secure your device. Create your pattern in the security settings, and unlock your phone by replicating it on the lock screen.

In essence, each unlocking method offered by the Samsung Galaxy F34 5G  provides a blend of security and ease. Whichever unlocking method you prefer, Google ensures that accessing your phone is secure and convenient.

Like most people, you probably lock your Samsung phone as soon as you turn it on. It's a good way to keep your phone safe from prying eyes and accidental button presses. But what happens when you forget your phone's passcode? Or worse, what if your phone gets locked by a malicious app?

- **Step 4**: Simply click on "Lock".
- **Step 5**: Enter a password that is not your Google account password in the "New Password" field.
