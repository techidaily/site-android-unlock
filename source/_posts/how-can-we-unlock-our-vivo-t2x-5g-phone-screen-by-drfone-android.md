## Rootjunky APK To Bypass Google FRP Lock For Vivo T2x 5G 

Factory Reset Protection (FRP) is a security feature built into Android devices running Android 5.1 Lollipop and later versions.

The FRP makes it much less attractive for thieves to steal Android phones, knowing they will need help to access them.

FRP automatically activates when you add a Google account to your Android phone. It links the Vivo T2x 5G device to your account, making it the “trusted owner.” Once activated, FRP becomes embedded in the phone’s system.
