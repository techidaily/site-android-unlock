### 1\. A Picture Possibly Bypasses Face Lock

You can use your photo to manipulate the face lock app. Simply use your photo to unlock the phone, which should work fine. If your phone doesn't recognize your face from a photo, try again.

If it still doesn't recognize your face, try a different photo or even change the camera's lighting settings or the angles to see if that helps.

Anyway, this method is still unstable because of many uncontrollable factors. If everything fails, consider the following methods to bypass the face lock.

### 2\. Hard Reset your phone

To get around the Android lock screen, perform a factory reset. While resetting your phone allows you to set a new password, it also erases all data from your device. This method works like a charm, but it also requires more technical knowledge. To bypass screen lock via factory reset, follow these steps.

![android hard reset](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/face-unlock-android-2.jpg)

**Step 1**: Turn off your phone and hold the Power and Volume-down buttons simultaneously until the recovery mode screen appears. There are minor variations depending on the brand and model.

**Step 2**: Select the Wipe data/Factory Reset option using the volume buttons. To confirm the option, press the Power button.

**Step 3**: Choose Yes > Delete All User Data, then press the power button to continue. When the process is complete, turn on your phone.

So, before facing such awkward cases, like data loss, we suggest you have a backup habit of keeping your data safe.

### 3\. Google Find My Device

Google Find My Device is a service that lets you remotely lock, track, and wipe data from stolen or lost phones. With a Google account and the password, it won't be complicated to remove any locks on your phone. You can bypass the Android lock screen by following the steps below:

![google find my device data reset](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/face-unlock-android-3.jpg)

**Step 1:** Navigate to Find My Device and sign in with your Google account.

**Step 2:** Your phone receives a notification.

**Step 3:** Select Erase Device, confirm, and click Erase as a warning pops up on the screen.

**Step 4:** The factory reset process on your phone begins. When it's finished, choose My Google Account instead of using your phone as if it were brand new.

Just like the hard reset, after using Google Find My Device, all your data and settings will be erased. Please make everything well prepared before you decide to unlock your device.
