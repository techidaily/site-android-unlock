### Using Google Account Details

Almost all Android smartphones, including Lava Yuva 2 , require you to enter your Google account details when setting up your phone for the first time. This account comes in handy later on in situations where your phone is lost or stolen or if you’re switching to another phone. However, it can also help with basic issues like unlocking your phone in case you forget your Lava Yuva 2  screen unlock PIN, pattern, or password. But to use this method successfully, you need to remember the email address bound to the Lava Yuva 2 device and its password.

Here's how to unlock the Lava Yuva 2  pattern lock without losing data using your Google account:

- **Step 1:** Enter the incorrect PIN, pattern, or password 5 times, and click on “Forgot Password” or “Forgot Pattern.”
- **Step 2:** The interface will then ask you to enter your Google account details as an alternate option. Enter the Google account details you used when setting up your Lava Yuva 2  phone.
- **Step 3:** This will unlock your phone. You can now reset the screen unlock PIN, password, or pattern.

If you don't remember your Google account details, you can still unlock your Lava Yuva 2  phone using a third-party tool.

## How to Remove Operator Lock on Lava Yuva 2 ?

An operator lock, also called a carrier lock, constitutes a limitation imposed on a mobile phone by a network provider. This measure is implemented to guarantee that the Lava Yuva 2 device exclusively functions with the services provided by that specific carrier. If you wish to remove the operator lock from your Lava Yuva 2  device, you'll need to follow specific steps and meet certain criteria. Here's how to remove the operator lock on a Lava Yuva 2 :

**Step 1:** Begin by checking whether your device can be unlocked or not from its network carrier restrictions. To do that, you need to dial the code “\*#\*#7378423#\*#\*” on your device, tap “Service Info” and select “SIM Lock.”

![dial the provided number](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/10/unlock-sony-xperia-pin-code-5.jpg)

**Step 2:** Carefully check the information provided on the screen. If there is "X" before the "Network" option and the number in front of it is larger than 0, it means your device can be unlocked. If the number in front of "Network" is 0, your device can't be unlocked as it is hard-locked.

![check the network status](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/10/unlock-sony-xperia-pin-code-6.jpg)

**Step 3:** The next step involves getting your device’s IMEI number. To accomplish this task, simply input "\*#06#" on your device.
