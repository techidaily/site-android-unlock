Asus ROG Phone 8  is the flagship device of HTC by all means. With a world of features and offerings, Asus ROG Phone 8  truly is a beast. While the phone is very powerful without any modifications, the true potential is yet to be seen and that can only be done if the bootloader is unlocked. So, to have a complete control over the Asus ROG Phone 8  device, it is important to unlock the bootloader and the process has to be carried out diligently. One of the initial things that needs to be ensured is that the Asus ROG Phone 8  device is fully charged or atleast 80% mark. Make sure you have the fastboot drivers for the Asus ROG Phone 8 device configured on the windows machine and the Android SDK. Here are some of the steps which can be followed to unlock bootloader.

Step 1: It is always very important to keep the phone data backed up and more so when you are planning to unlock the bootloader.

As one of the initial measures, backup the Asus ROG Phone 8 device completely as bootloader unlocking process will wipe all the data off. So, backup all the data like photos, contacts, multimedia files, documents, etc.

After selecting the Asus ROG Phone 8 device, click on “Begin Unlock Bootloader”, and then confirm all the dialogue boxes which come your way on screen.

Step 4: Now, you will be presented with four steps to put the Asus ROG Phone 8 device in bootloader mode. Disconnect the Asus ROG Phone 8  device from the PC and turn the Asus ROG Phone 8 device off completely. Press the volume down button along with the power button to switch the Asus ROG Phone 8 device on in bootloader mode.

Step 6: Go to Fastboot folder on the PC and holding down the shift key, click on any empty space followed by a click on “Open command window here”.

Step 7: In the command prompt window, type “fastboot devices” and press enter. Asus ROG Phone 8  will show up in the command prompt.

Note: The drivers have to be installed correctly to see the Asus ROG Phone 8 device in the command prompt. So, if the Asus ROG Phone 8 device does not show up, reinstall HTC Sync Manager and try again after restarting the computer.

Step 8: On HTC Dev’s website third page, click on “proceed to Step 9”. Follow the steps listed and then click on submit. The unlock token code for the Asus ROG Phone 8 device will be mailed by HTC. Download the token and name it “Unlock\_code.bin” and place the token in the fastboot folder.

fastboot flash unlocktoken Unlock\_code.bin

Step 10: On the Asus ROG Phone 8 , one message will appear asking if you want to unlock the Asus ROG Phone 8 device bootloader.
