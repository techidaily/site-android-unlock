## Part 3: Turn On Smart Lock For Android With Trusted Locations

You can also add locations or addresses to Smart Lock Trusted Locations, and the phone unlocks automatically as soon as you arrive at the desired location. For example, you can set up your home or work address under Trusted Locations.

Check current settings first.

Tap on Add Trusted Places

- • Initiate the Google Maps app on the Android phone. Make sure the Internet and GPS are on.
- • Pick a place.

![smart lock android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14555203265722.jpg)

- • Click on Settings.
- • Click on Edit home or work. You can now add or edit the required addresses.
- • As an example, click on the Enter work address.
- • You now have the option to type in the address or use the address listed on Google Maps as the required work address.

![smart lock android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14555204276666.jpg)

- • A successful addition is listed and can be edited under the Edit work address.

- • However, it is not yet configured as a Smart Lock option. Tap the location once, and it is enabled.
- • The switch along the address to the right turns blue, indicating it is enabled.
- • The work address is now listed under Trusted places for Work.

![smart lock android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14555206499484.jpg)

- • The phone is now configured for the work address and will unlock whenever you are at the location.
- • Since it works on Google Maps, the feature works through an Internet connection.

## Part 4: Turn On Smart Lock For Android With Trusted Face

![smart lock android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14555207782388.jpg)

The feature recognizes your face and then unlocks the Motorola Razr 40 Ultra device. Once you set up the Motorola Razr 40 Ultra device to recognize your face as a trusted face, it will unlock the Motorola Razr 40 Ultra device as soon as it recognizes you.

![smart lock android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14555208588486.jpg)

PRECAUTION:  At best, this can be the first level of security, as one who resembles you to some extent can unlock the Motorola Razr 40 Ultra device. Photographs are not stored in the system. The device does hold necessary data to recognize your face, and the security level is determined by how good the Motorola Razr 40 Ultra device is configured. The data is not accessed by any app or loaded onto a Google server for backup.

_Setting Up Trusted Face_

- • Go to Smart Lock and tap Trusted Face.
- • Tap on Setup. Follow on-screen instructions.

![smart lock android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14555210728317.jpg)

The device begins to gather data about your face. The trusted face icon appears. As a backup, in case Smart Lock does not recognize your face, use the manual system by applying the PIN or password to unlock the Motorola Razr 40 Ultra device.

![smart lock android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14555211623749.jpg)

In case Trusted Face is not required, tap on reset Trusted Face appearing under the Trusted Face menu. Tap on Reset to reset the option.

_How To Improve Facial Recognition In Your Bluetooth and Android NFC Unlock Devices_

![smart lock android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14555212902436.jpg)

- • If you feel facial recognition is not up to the mark, go to Smart Lock and tap on a Trusted face.
- • Tap on Improve face matching.
- • Tap on Next and follow instructions on the screen to complete the task.

Smart Lock Android is a great feature and is only going to improve on time. With added security measures being introduced by Google for Bluetooth and NFC unlock android devices, including configuration to Google maps and Gmail, the feature may be one of the most important features to overcome constant blocking of devices even in protected places.
