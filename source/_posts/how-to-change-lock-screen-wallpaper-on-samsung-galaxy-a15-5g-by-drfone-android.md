- **Step 3.** SAfter running the Android Multi tool on your PC, you will see onscreen instructions like different numbers for different functions. Press on a number for which action you want to perform. For unlocking patterns, there is a numbering button so you will go for that.
- **Step 4.** SYou will see that your phone has started rebooting after pressing a specific button. Wait until you see it starts automatically. When the phone will start, you could use it without any problem. Good thing is that this tool also does not delete data while unlocking your pattern lock.

## Part 3: A Comprehensive Comparison: Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (Android) vs. Android Multi Tool

Well, you have come to know great things about the two pattern lock remover tools: Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock and Android Multi Tool.

Now, take a look at these tools' comparison.

| **Features** | **Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (Android) ![hot icon](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/05/hot-tip.png)**  | **Android Multi Tool** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Unlock pattern locks without deleting data | Yes | Yes |
| Easy to use | Yes | Technical skills required. |
| High-success Rate | Yes | This tool may sometimes not work.  |

One of the standout features of [Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (Android)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare-dr-fone-unlock-android-screen/) is its simplicity. The software is designed to be easy to use, even for those with little technical knowledge.

One key advantage of Android Multi Tool is its compatibility with a wide range of Android devices. However, it's worth noting that due to its open-source nature, Android Multi Tool may not receive regular updates and bug fixes, which could potentially lead to compatibility issues with newer Android versions.

In terms of customer support, Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (Android) excels.
