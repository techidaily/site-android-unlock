**Step 6.** Wait until everything is done. You should then see your device already has no lock screen.

That's how to unlock an Android phone with just one click using Wondershare's Dr.Fone. If your device is not Samsung or LG, you can use a more advanced mode to [unlock your phone](https://drfone.wondershare.com/guide/android-lock-screen-removal.html).


## Part 2. How to Unlock Android Phone with Aroma File Manager (with Data Loss)/h2>

If you weren't able to open your Wi-Fi or data connection or enable USB Debugging, this is the way for you to unlock your lock screen. This could be a bit complicated, but it should work.

**Steps are provided below, and please follow the step-by-step guide carefully to avoid a boot loop or any other damage.**

**Step 1.** Download [Aroma File Manager](https://code.google.com/archive/p/rom-cmexmini/downloads) on your PC. This is a tool that unlocks Android phones. Android users can use it for free.

![Aroma File Manager download page](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/06/14647610652100.jpg)

**Step 2.** Go to your Downloads folders and copy the downloaded zip file.

![Copy Aroma zip file](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/06/14647610755085.jpg)

**Step 3.** Plug into your PC a memory card that you can insert into your phone later. Then, go to your list of connected devices and select the memory card.

![open memory card on pc](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/06/14647610775226.jpg)

**Step 4.** Paste the copied Aroma zip file. Once copied, eject it from your PC, then insert it into your Android device.

![Paste aroma file manager](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/06/14647610796449.jpg)

![arom file manager pasted](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/06/14647610819837.jpg)

**Step 5.** Enter Recovery Mode for your device. Each Android device has its own ways of entering recovery mode, so take a look at this [link](http://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/use-recovery-mode-android/) and find your device.

![Enter recovery mode android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/06/14647615647569.jpg)

**Step 6.** When you are already in Android Recovery Mode, use your volume keys to navigate to ''apply update from external storage'', then select the zip file you copied a while ago. It will be flashed on your device.

![Android system recovery](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/06/14647615657193.jpg)

**Step 7.** After it, restart, and recovery mode will reopen as Aroma File Manager, so go to its settings and select ''Automount all devices on start'', then restart. Back in Aroma File Manager, go to the directory data>system. Check if the ff. exist. If they do, delete them. Then restart again.

![arom file manager](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/06/14647610871048.jpg)

Now you have your device booted up, and your Android lock screen is still locked, just gesture in or enter anything. It will be unlocked. And that's how to unlock an Android phone using your device.

## Part 3. How to Unlock Android Phone Using Minimal ADB and Fastboot (with Data Loss)

If you weren't able to connect to the Internet, but you, fortunately, enabled your USB Debugging option before your device was locked, the ARONSDB tool from the Android SDK package can help you unlock your Android phone.

**Here is the step-by-step guide for you to follow**

**Step 1.** Go to [Minimal ADB and Fastboot](https://androidmtk.com/download-minimal-adb-and-fastboot-tool) download page.

![Minimal adb and fastboot dowload page](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/06/14648313491726.jpg)

**Step 2.** Download the tool's latest version.

![Minimal adb and fastboot downloaded](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/06/14648313521345.jpg)

**Step 3.** Open the downloaded Minimal ADB and Fastbootzip file and install it.

![Minimal adb and fastboot installer zip](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/06/14648313544528.jpg)

![Minimal adb and fastboot setup](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/06/14648313551732.jpg)

![Minimal adb and fastboot installation complete](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/06/14648313566582.jpg)

**Step 4.** Make sure your device is connected, then go to the Minimal ADB and Fastboot installation directory.

This PC \[Win 8& 10\] or My computer \[Windows 7 & below\]> Local Disk (C:) \[primary drive\]> Program Files \[for 32-bit\] or Program Files (x86) \[for 64-bit\] > Minimal ADB and Fasboot.

![Local Disk](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/06/14648313589887.jpg)

![Program Files (x86) folder](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/06/14648313591963.jpg)

![Minimal adb and fastboot folder](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/06/14648313625020.jpg)

**Step 5.** Inside the folder, hold the Shift key on your keyboard, then right-click your mouse. An additional "Open command window here" will appear so select that.

![Minimal adb and fastboot open command](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/06/14648313653169.jpg)

**Step 6.** ADB terminal will pop out. Now, the first is to type in ADB _devices_. This is to check if your device is recognized by ADB. If there is no device listed below, try to remove and reconnect your Samsung Galaxy A23 5G and retype the command. If there are listed devices already, proceed.

![Minimal adb and fastboot command window adb devices command](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/06/14648317691463.jpg)

**Step 7.** Finally, type in the following commands **one by one****.** These commands will remove your lock screen.

- _adb shell_
- _cd /data/data/com.android.providers.settings/databases_
- _sqlite3 settings.db_
- _update system set value=0 where_
- _name='lock\_pattern\_autolock';_
- _update system set value=0 where_
- _name='lockscreen.lockedoutpermanently';_
- _.quit_

![Minimal adb and fastboot adb shell command](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/06/14648317729484.jpg)

This would work if you have your USB debugging turned on before it was locked. That's how to unlock Android using ADB.

## Part 4: How to Unlock Phone via Find My Device (with Data Loss)

Google Find My Device is another handy way to unlock your locked Android device. However, it requires you to have your Google ID credentials and you have previously enabled Find My Device features. Moreover, it will erase all the data on your device. Use the following steps to unlock your Android phone via Find My Device:

**Step 1:** Open a web browser on a computer or another device and visit the Find My Device website. Now, sign in with the Google account that is linked to the locked Android device.

**Step 2:** After signing in, you will see a list of devices associated with your Google account on the left side of the screen. Select the locked Android device from the list and choose the "Erase Device" option from the menu on the left-hand side.

![tap on erase device option](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/09/unlock-android-phone-1.jpg)

**Step 3:** You will now be asked to confirm your identity through a Google account password or using a pass-key. Afterward, follow the on-screen instructions to erase and unlock your Android device.

## Part 5: How to Unlock Android Phone without Losing Data in Safe Mode

One way to unlock your Android phone without losing the data is by utilizing Safe Mode. This method works only if the screen lock you have been using is a third-party app. Since Safe Mode disables third-party apps, you can easily use it to uninstall the problematic app. Here is **how to unlock an Android phone without losing data**:

**Step 1:** On your Android device, press and hold “Power” and “Volume Down” keys together for 3 seconds. After the Power menu becomes visible, press and hold the “Power off” option.

**Step 2:** After a while, you will see the "Safe Mode" option on your screen with some basic instructions. Now, you can use the button to boot into Safe Mode and remove the screen lock application.

![restart android device in safe mode](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/09/unlock-android-phone-2.jpg)

## Part 6. How to Unlock Android Phone without Any Data Loss Using Google Account (Android 4.4 or lower)

If luckily, you left your Wi-Fi open and luckily connected to the internet, this is the easiest way to unlock your Android phone.

**The step-by-step guide for you to refer**

**Step 1:** Retry the incorrect password or pattern until the ''Forgotten Password/Pattern'' appears below. Then select that.

![android forgot pattern lock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/06/14648495587136.jpg)

**Step 2:** Check ''Enter your Google Account details'' then tap next.

![Unlock screen enter google account details](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/06/14648495698424.jpg)

**Step 3:** Input your Google Account details, username, and password. You are done.

![Account unlock Google](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/06/14648495811338.jpg)

You will be given the option to input a new password or pattern right after you enter your Google account details. But if not, Google must have emailed you your temporary password or pattern that you will input to unlock your lock screen.
