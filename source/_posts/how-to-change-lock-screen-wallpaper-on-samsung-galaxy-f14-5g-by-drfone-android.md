Samsung Galaxy F14 5G  is the flagship device of HTC by all means. With a world of features and offerings, Samsung Galaxy F14 5G  truly is a beast. While the phone is very powerful without any modifications, the true potential is yet to be seen and that can only be done if the bootloader is unlocked. So, to have a complete control over the Samsung Galaxy F14 5G  device, it is important to unlock the bootloader and the process has to be carried out diligently. One of the initial things that needs to be ensured is that the Samsung Galaxy F14 5G  device is fully charged or atleast 80% mark. Make sure you have the fastboot drivers for the Samsung Galaxy F14 5G device configured on the windows machine and the Android SDK. Here are some of the steps which can be followed to unlock bootloader.
