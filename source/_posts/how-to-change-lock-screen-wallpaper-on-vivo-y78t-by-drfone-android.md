## How to Unlock Vivo Y78t  PIN Code/Pattern Lock/Password

_I have forgotten the pattern, PIN, or password needed to unlock my Vivo Y78t  smartphone. What should I do?_

If you have a Vivo Y78t  phone and have forgotten the screen unlock PIN code, pattern lock, or password, you can still access it using some tried and tested tricks and hacks. This article will discuss 5 different ways on how to unlock **Vivo Y78t  smartphone**. Some methods might work without erasing your data, while others, like factory resetting, may erase all content from your phone. Regardless of which method you use, you will be able to unlock your phone! So, let’s get started!

## 1\. How to Unlock Vivo Y78t  With Google Find My Vivo Y78t?

A way to unlock the Vivo Y78t  phone is via Google Find My Device feature. While this method can help unlock your phone, it erases all content from it.

For this method, you need a PC and your Google account details. Here are the steps for it:

**Step 1:** Open your browser and go to [Google Find My Device](https://www.google.com/android/find) on your PC.

![google account verification](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/05/google-account-verification.jpg)

**Step 2:** Log in to the Google account you used to set up your Vivo Y78t  phone.

**Step 3:** It will show you 3 options: Play Sound, Secure Device, and Erase Device.

![find my device](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/05/google-find-my-device.jpg)

Use this method only if your phone is backed up so you can restore all your data later.

### Using Google Account Details

Almost all Android smartphones, including Vivo Y78t , require you to enter your Google account details when setting up your phone for the first time.

However, it can also help with basic issues like unlocking your phone in case you forget your Vivo Y78t  screen unlock PIN, pattern, or password. But to use this method successfully, you need to remember the email address bound to the Vivo Y78t device and its password.

Here's how to unlock the Vivo Y78t  pattern lock without losing data using your Google account:

- **Step 1:** Enter the incorrect PIN, pattern, or password 5 times, and click on “Forgot Password” or “Forgot Pattern.”

- **Step 3:** This will unlock your phone. You can now reset the screen unlock PIN, password, or pattern.

If you don't remember your Google account details, you can still unlock your Vivo Y78t  phone using a third-party tool.

### Using Security Question

Another way to unlock your Vivo Y78t  phone using Google is by answering the security question. When we set up our Google account, we usually choose a security question and an answer. This comes in handy if you want to recover your Google account, reset the password, or if you want to unlock your phone's screen.

For the latter, here are the steps:

- **Step 1:** Enter the incorrect PIN or pattern to unlock your screen several times till you see the “Forgot Pattern” or “Forgot Password” option. Click on it.
- **Step 2:** Now select the “Answer Security Question” option and type in the answer.
- **Step 3:** Click on “Unlock” after which you will be asked if you want to set a new PIN or pattern. Select “Yes.”

**Step 2:** Carefully check the information provided on the screen. If there is "X" before the "Network" option and the number in front of it is larger than 0, it means your device can be unlocked. If the number in front of "Network" is 0, your device can't be unlocked as it is hard-locked.

**Step 3:** The next step involves getting your device’s IMEI number. To accomplish this task, simply input "\*#06#" on your device. Once you have the IMEI number, use a reliable service from the internet to the unlocking code. Insert the SIM card of another network and provide the code you gained to unlock your Vivo Y78t  device.
