## How To Change Vivo T2 Pro 5G Lock Screen Password?

Setting up a lock screen is a crucial step in protecting your phone's data. If you're not sure how to create one on your Android™ phone, we're here to help.

Your Android lock screen pin or password and your Google Account password are two passwords you use frequently. Keeping a good lock screen passcode is important.

Although you might not frequently enter your lock screen pin or password if you use a biometric unlocking method like fingerprint or facial recognition, it's still important to be familiar with it.

You'll need to reset your Google Account password if you forget it or become locked out for some other reason when you try to keep accessing all of your data. You might also need to change lock screen passcode from time to time.

![how to set up password](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/how-to-change-lock-screen-password-2.jpg)

**Swipe:** This lock type allows you to swipe in any direction on your screen to unlock your phone.

**Pattern:** If you opt to unlock your phone in this manner, you must create a pattern on a 3-by-3-dot grid.

**Pin:** A PIN lock is a four-digit code. Make sure you select a set of numbers that you can quickly recall.

**Password:** Your phone's highest level of security. Your password must be distinct, easily remembered, and include at least one letter and 7 characters.

Follow the setup instructions on-screen after selecting the security measure you prefer.

Additionally, you'll notice options to enable fingerprint or face biometric recognition features. Iris Scanner (S8/S8+) or Intelligent Scan (S9/S9+) may also be available on some older Samsung® models.

**Face recognition:** By holding your face directly in front of your phone's screen, you may unlock your phone and authenticate yourself in apps.

With fingerprints, you can quickly touch your finger to unlock your phone.

**Iris:** Check your eyes to make sure that only you can see the contents of your phone.

**Intelligent Scan:** A method of device unlocking that combines face and iris recognition technology.

Follow on-screen instructions if you decide to employ one of these sophisticated security technologies, or go to Settings > Biometrics and security for more customization choices.

## How to look up saved passwords on my device?

The way that Google Chrome manages your usernames and passwords is excellent. But what if you want to log in to a particular website from another device but can't recall your password, and the website won't load the data for you? You may quickly obtain a list of all saved passwords by browsing through Chrome's settings, then manually keying it in.

You may access the passwords saved in the Google Chrome app on a Mac or PC because the app is connected to your Google account. Any passwords saved on your Android phone can easily be removed via the Chrome app.

## How to Unlock a Network Locked Vivo T2 Pro 5G Phone?

Revolutions in the telecommunication industry have introduced advancements in smartphone features and utilities. The other side of the coin is, however, not as appealing. Thanks to the different carrier services, network locking is the commonest issue of recent mobile launches. Users have reported of Vivo T2 Pro 5G phones refusing to work with different carriers.

The issue limits the smartphone's functioning to the specific carrier from whom the Vivo T2 Pro 5G device is purchased. Consequently, there are annoying connectivity problems that restrict seamless mobile usage. The problem aggravates in geo-restricted regions where the carrier options are quite limited. This scenario puts forward the need for **Vivo T2 Pro 5G network unlock** solutions.

## Part 1: What Does It Mean When Your Vivo T2 Pro 5G Phone is Network Locked?

In the simplest words, a network-locked Vivo T2 Pro 5G phone means that your device has become carrier-specific. It will now work only with the network provider from where the phone was purchased. Another problem is that there is no automatic unlocking even after the expiry of your contract with the carrier service. Having a network-locked Vivo T2 Pro 5G phone poses undesired connectivity issues.

### 1\. Why is my phone locked to the network carrier?

Smartphones are network locked by carrier services to prevent customers from switching to a different carrier. Reasons for switching can be the availability of better plans, discounts, etc. Another cause of locking the phones to specific carriers is preventing them from theft and unauthorized usage.

## Rootjunky APK To Bypass Google FRP Lock For Vivo T2 Pro 5G 

Factory Reset Protection (FRP) is a security feature built into Android devices running Android 5.1 Lollipop and later versions. It prevents someone from using your phone after a factory data reset without Google account login credentials. The FRP makes it much less attractive for thieves to steal Android phones, knowing they will need help to access them.

FRP automatically activates when you add a Google account to your Android phone. It links the Vivo T2 Pro 5G device to your account, making it the “trusted owner.” Once activated, FRP becomes embedded in the phone’s system.

While Google FRP is a valuable security feature, it’s vital to acknowledge that there are legitimate situations where bypassing it might be necessary. These instances include forgotten Google account credentials, buying a second-hand device, and device issues. In these cases, tools like **RootJunky** can help you [<u>bypass FRP Lock</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/google-frp-unlock/bypass-frp-with-computer.html).
