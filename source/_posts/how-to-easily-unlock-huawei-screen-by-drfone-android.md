Finally, trusted face unlocking is the ultimate face recognition system that unlocks your Android device as soon as you look at it across the front-facing camera. A face unlock first introduced with Android Jelly Bean and has been significantly improved in later versions.

_Turning On Smart Lock_

The feature is enabled by first accessing settings. For example, in a Samsung Galaxy S6:

Tap on Settings, which is the gear symbol.

![smart lock android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14555171833750.jpg)

- • Click on Personal and tap on Security.
- • Go to Advanced and tap on Trust agents and make sure Smart Lock is turned on.

![smart lock android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14555174399892.jpg)

- • Under Screen Security tap Smart Lock.
- • Here, you need to enter your Screen Lock. If you haven't done so, set up a password and PIN by following the on-screen prompts. The screen Lock is needed every time you have to change the Smart Lock settings.

Within Smart Lock, there are three options for setting the system. You can set up trusted devices, trusted face, and trusted places individually, combining two or all three at the same time. You can choose just one trusted face, but you have the option to set up as many trusted devices and trusted places as needed.

## Part 2: Turn On Smart Lock For Android with Trusted Devices

You can decide on a trusted device to be paired with Smart Lock Android.

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://propmoneyinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/1803115/14559" target="_top" id="1803115"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/14559-1803115" border="0" alt="" width="859" height="859"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1803115/14559" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![smart lock android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14555177245258.jpg)

For example, you can set up a Smart Lock for Bluetooth in your Android Bluetooth settings. It can also be done for Android NFC unlock devices. Examples include the Bluetooth system in your car, NFC unlocks, android sticker on the car's phone dock, or Bluetooth in your watch.

- • Go to Settings.
- • Tap on Security and then Smart Lock.
- • Existing paired options are listed under Trusted Devices.
- • Initially, trusted devices will show None.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![smart lock android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14555179612746.jpg)

Tap on Add Trusted Devices.

![smart lock android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14555180455802.jpg)

The next screen is the Choose Device Type.

![smart lock android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14555181196889.jpg)

Since you have already paired Bluetooth, it will ask you to choose the Huawei Nova Y71 device from the list.

![smart lock android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14555182031784.jpg)

- • As an example, let's take the case of LG HBS800. It may show Not connected until you add it.
- • It will show up under Trusted devices in the Smart Lock menu.
- • When you turn the added device on, Smart Lock now unlocks the Android mobile.

![smart lock android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14555183103300.jpg)

Similarly, other Bluetooth and NFC unlock android supported gadgets can be added under the list of Trusted Devices.

## Part 3: Turn On Smart Lock For Android With Trusted Locations

You can also add locations or addresses to Smart Lock Trusted Locations, and the phone unlocks automatically as soon as you arrive at the desired location. For example, you can set up your home or work address under Trusted Locations.

Check current settings first.

![smart lock android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14555198742115.jpg)

On a new Android phone, visit Settings>Personal.

- • The work address is now listed under Trusted places for Work.

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![smart lock android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14555206499484.jpg)

## Part 4: Turn On Smart Lock For Android With Trusted Face

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://proteahair.pxf.io/c/5597632/1983634/23621" target="_top" id="1983634"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/23621-1983634" border="0" alt="" width="320" height="100"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1983634/23621" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![smart lock android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14555207782388.jpg)

The feature recognizes your face and then unlocks the Huawei Nova Y71 device. Once you set up the Huawei Nova Y71 device to recognize your face as a trusted face, it will unlock the Huawei Nova Y71 device as soon as it recognizes you.

![smart lock android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14555208588486.jpg)

PRECAUTION:  At best, this can be the first level of security, as one who resembles you to some extent can unlock the Huawei Nova Y71 device. Photographs are not stored in the system. The device does hold necessary data to recognize your face, and the security level is determined by how good the Huawei Nova Y71 device is configured. The data is not accessed by any app or loaded onto a Google server for backup.

_Setting Up Trusted Face_

- • Go to Smart Lock and tap Trusted Face.
- • Tap on Setup. Follow on-screen instructions.

![smart lock android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14555210728317.jpg)

The device begins to gather data about your face. The trusted face icon appears. As a backup, in case Smart Lock does not recognize your face, use the manual system by applying the PIN or password to unlock the Huawei Nova Y71 device.

![smart lock android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14555211623749.jpg)

In case Trusted Face is not required, tap on reset Trusted Face appearing under the Trusted Face menu. Tap on Reset to reset the option.

_How To Improve Facial Recognition In Your Bluetooth and Android NFC Unlock Devices_

![smart lock android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14555212902436.jpg)

- • If you feel facial recognition is not up to the mark, go to Smart Lock and tap on a Trusted face.
- • Tap on Improve face matching.
- • Tap on Next and follow instructions on the screen to complete the task.

Smart Lock Android is a great feature and is only going to improve on time. With added security measures being introduced by Google for Bluetooth and NFC unlock android devices, including configuration to Google maps and Gmail, the feature may be one of the most important features to overcome constant blocking of devices even in protected places.
