## Part 1: An Introduction to IMEI Numbers and Its Utility

Every mobile device has a special identifier that is helpful in the **anti-theft app & IMEI tracker** activities. It is known as the International Mobile Equipment Identity or IMEI number. While often overlooked, it holds the key to many essential services and functions.

This makes it an indispensable component of modern mobile technology. The IMEI number serves as a digital fingerprint for mobile phones. Its primary purposes are summarized below:

1. **Device Identification:** Each mobile device possesses a distinct IMEI number. This sets it apart from every other phone in existence. This identification is essential for cellular networks and service providers. It helps in recognizing, managing, and connecting devices accurately.
2. **Traceability and Tracking:** In cases of theft, loss, or unauthorized use, the IMEI number becomes a crucial tool for tracking. It provides law enforcement agencies with the means to pinpoint the Motorola G24 Power device's location.

### 2\. Using Recovery Mode

![recovery mode](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/how-to-change-lock-screen-password-4.jpg)

Users of Android smartphones and tablets can troubleshoot various issues with their devices using a feature known as Android Recovery Mode. It might be helpful if you discover that your device is functioning strangely. Recovery Mode Android technically refers to a unique bootable partition with a recovery application installed inside it.

However, users can also use it to reset the android password if it is forgotten. The instructions for resetting android devices through recovery mode are different for every android device.

### 3\. Forgot Password Feature (Android 4.4 and Lower)

In case you lose your pattern, PIN, or other passwords, older versions of Android, including Android 4.4 KitKat, have an integrated feature to let you continue using your device.

Enter an erroneous pattern or PIN five times on the lock screen to reveal this function. A button with the words "Forgot pattern," "Forgot PIN," or "Forgot password" will show up. Tap it. The username and password for the Google account connected to your Android smartphone will be required.
