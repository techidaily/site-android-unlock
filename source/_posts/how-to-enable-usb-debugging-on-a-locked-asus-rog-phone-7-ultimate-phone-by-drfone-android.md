## How to Remove Operator Lock on Asus ROG Phone 7 Ultimate ?

An operator lock, also called a carrier lock, constitutes a limitation imposed on a mobile phone by a network provider. This measure is implemented to guarantee that the Asus ROG Phone 7 Ultimate device exclusively functions with the services provided by that specific carrier. If you wish to remove the operator lock from your Asus ROG Phone 7 Ultimate  device, you'll need to follow specific steps and meet certain criteria. Here's how to remove the operator lock on a Asus ROG Phone 7 Ultimate :

**Step 1:** Begin by checking whether your device can be unlocked or not from its network carrier restrictions. To do that, you need to dial the code “\*#\*#7378423#\*#\*” on your device, tap “Service Info” and select “SIM Lock.”
