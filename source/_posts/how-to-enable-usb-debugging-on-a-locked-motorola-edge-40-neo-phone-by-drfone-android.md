## Method 3: Factory Reset Motorola Edge 40 Neo  Phones (Wipes User Data)

There is a standard factory reset built into every Motorola Edge 40 Neo  phone to allow users to erase the Motorola Edge 40 Neo device and start over fully. This option wipes all user data and resets the phone to how you received it in the box.

Overall, this method consumes a lot of time.

**Step 1:** Go to Settings > Backup & Reset.

**Step 2:** Tap Factory Reset > Reset Phone.

**Step 3:** Tap Erase Everything.
