## How to Lock Apps on Motorola G54 5G to Protect Your Individual Information

If you are not a fan of having to go through the process of getting through a [pattern](https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/pattern-lock.html) or password every time you want to use your phone, the good news is that you don’t have to. There are really just a few Apps on your Android device that have sensitive information you don’t want others getting access to. It would really be great if you could lock those apps individually as opposed to locking the Motorola G54 5G device as a whole.

Well, in light of helping you out, this article will address just how you can lock Apps on your device and not have to type in a code every time you want to use the Motorola G54 5G device.

## Part 1. Why you need to Lock Apps on Android?

Before we get down to the business of locking some of your Apps, let’s look at some of the reasons why you would want to lock certain apps.

- You may simply want better access on your device. Locking certain apps will allow you to easily access the Motorola G54 5G device and use it without having to remember passwords and patterns.
- If you are a person who is not good at remembering passwords or patterns, simply locking certain apps will help you not get locked out of your entire device which can cause a lot of problems.
- If your device is used by more than one person, locking certain apps will keep the other users out of information you would rather they didn’t access.
- If you have children, you can eliminate the many accidental in-app purchases by locking the apps your children shouldn’t be on.
- Locking apps is also a good way to keep children from content they shouldn’t be accessing.

## Part 1: What is Android Smart Lock?

![smart lock android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14555162221345.jpg)

Android Lollipop added a feature called Smart Lock, and the feature was devised as a smart tool to prevent the Android phone from locking once it was initially unlocked. In other words, the feature overrides an Android phone's Lock Screen feature, thereby saving users the need to enter passwords every time the Motorola G54 5G device locks.

If you're at home, it's likely your android phone is locked out if you haven't accessed at for some time. Smart Locks solves the problem in many ways. It allows you to allocate trusted places. Once you within range of the trusted places, your phone won't lock. Trusted devices come next. Smart Lock is assigned to Bluetooth and Android NFC unlock devices.

Finally, trusted face unlocking is the ultimate face recognition system that unlocks your Android device as soon as you look at it across the front-facing camera. A face unlock first introduced with Android Jelly Bean and has been significantly improved in later versions.

_Turning On Smart Lock_

The feature is enabled by first accessing settings. For example, in a Samsung Galaxy S6:

## Part 4: Turn On Smart Lock For Android With Trusted Face

![smart lock android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14555207782388.jpg)

The feature recognizes your face and then unlocks the Motorola G54 5G device. Once you set up the Motorola G54 5G device to recognize your face as a trusted face, it will unlock the Motorola G54 5G device as soon as it recognizes you.

![smart lock android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14555208588486.jpg)

PRECAUTION:  At best, this can be the first level of security, as one who resembles you to some extent can unlock the Motorola G54 5G device. Photographs are not stored in the system. The device does hold necessary data to recognize your face, and the security level is determined by how good the Motorola G54 5G device is configured. The data is not accessed by any app or loaded onto a Google server for backup.

_Setting Up Trusted Face_

- • Go to Smart Lock and tap Trusted Face.
- • Tap on Setup. Follow on-screen instructions.

![smart lock android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14555210728317.jpg)

The device begins to gather data about your face. The trusted face icon appears. As a backup, in case Smart Lock does not recognize your face, use the manual system by applying the PIN or password to unlock the Motorola G54 5G device.

![smart lock android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14555211623749.jpg)

In case Trusted Face is not required, tap on reset Trusted Face appearing under the Trusted Face menu. Tap on Reset to reset the option.

![smart lock android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14555212902436.jpg)

- • If you feel facial recognition is not up to the mark, go to Smart Lock and tap on a Trusted face.
- • Tap on Improve face matching.
- • Tap on Next and follow instructions on the screen to complete the task.

Smart Lock Android is a great feature and is only going to improve on time. With added security measures being introduced by Google for Bluetooth and NFC unlock android devices, including configuration to Google maps and Gmail, the feature may be one of the most important features to overcome constant blocking of devices even in protected places.
