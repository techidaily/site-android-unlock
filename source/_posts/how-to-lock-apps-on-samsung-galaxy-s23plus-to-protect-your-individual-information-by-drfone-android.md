## How to Lock Apps on Samsung Galaxy S23+ to Protect Your Individual Information

If you are not a fan of having to go through the process of getting through a [pattern](https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/pattern-lock.html) or password every time you want to use your phone, the good news is that you don’t have to. There are really just a few Apps on your Android device that have sensitive information you don’t want others getting access to. It would really be great if you could lock those apps individually as opposed to locking the Samsung Galaxy S23+ device as a whole.

Well, in light of helping you out, this article will address just how you can lock Apps on your device and not have to type in a code every time you want to use the Samsung Galaxy S23+ device.

## Part 1. Why you need to Lock Apps on Android?

- You may simply want better access on your device. Locking certain apps will allow you to easily access the Samsung Galaxy S23+ device and use it without having to remember passwords and patterns.
- If you are a person who is not good at remembering passwords or patterns, simply locking certain apps will help you not get locked out of your entire device which can cause a lot of problems.
- If your device is used by more than one person, locking certain apps will keep the other users out of information you would rather they didn’t access.
- If you have children, you can eliminate the many accidental in-app purchases by locking the apps your children shouldn’t be on.
- Locking apps is also a good way to keep children from content they shouldn’t be accessing.

## Method 1. Google Find My Device (Without Password/Pin/Pattern)

If you're like me, you've probably tried a million different ways to unlock your Samsung phone, only to be frustrated by the results. Luckily, there's an easy way to unlock your Samsung phone using Google's Find My Device feature.

Google will use your location, phone information, and connection log to find your Nokia.

Follow these steps to unlock the Samsung lock screen password without losing data:

- **Step 1**: Sign into your Google account and navigate the Find My Device website.

![google find my device](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/unlock-nokia-screen-2.jpg)

- **Step 2**: Sign in with your Google account, which you used on your locked Samsung phone.
- **Step 3**: The Android Device Manager dashboard will show your locked Samsung with three options: Ring, Lock, and Erase.
- **Step 4**: Simply click on "Lock".
- **Step 5**: Enter a password that is not your Google account password in the "New Password" field.
- **Step 6**: Type the new password in the "Confirm password" field. This password lock will replace the current lock screen.
- **Step 7**: You can leave the "Recovery message" field empty or type anything in it.
- **Step 8**: Enter another phone number in the "Phone number" field, although this is optional.
- **Step 9**: Choose "Lock" after entering your password and filling out the optional fields if you wish.
- **Step 10**: If the process is successful, you will receive the unlock code within a few seconds.
- **Step 11**: Navigate to the "Screen Settings" menu after unlocking your device.
- **Step 12**: Use a new password; you can use the temporary password if you want.

You can use it to unlock your Samsung if you have activated the Android Device Manager or Google Find My Device before your phone was locked.

### A few conditions, however, must be met for this to work

- You must turn on your Samsung phone.
- Before locking your phone, you must activate Google Find My Device or Android Device Manager.
- You must have your Samsung GPS turned on to use it.
- You must be connected to WiFi on your device to log into your Google account.
