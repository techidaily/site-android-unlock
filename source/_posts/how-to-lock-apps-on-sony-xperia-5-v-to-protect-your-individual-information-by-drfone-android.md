## How to Lock Apps on Sony Xperia 5 V to Protect Your Individual Information

If you are not a fan of having to go through the process of getting through a [pattern](https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/pattern-lock.html) or password every time you want to use your phone, the good news is that you don’t have to. There are really just a few Apps on your Android device that have sensitive information you don’t want others getting access to. It would really be great if you could lock those apps individually as opposed to locking the Sony Xperia 5 V device as a whole.

## Method 3: Factory Reset Sony Xperia 5 V  Phones (Wipes User Data)
