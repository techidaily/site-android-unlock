## Part 1: Lock System About Motorola Moto E13  

### 1: Lock Types

Before we move towards the **Motorola Moto E13  pattern unlock**, let's talk about its lock types and security system. Motorola Moto E13  is one of the older versions of Motorola  android phones that was released in 2016. At that time, only flagship phones from each brand came with features like fingerprint sensors and facial unlock. Motorola Moto E13  doesn't offer these lock types. You can only set up a screen lock as a password, pattern, and PIN. You can also lock apps on Motorola Moto E13  with its privacy password settings.

### 2: How to Set Them up?

Follow these steps to set up any type of lock on your Motorola Moto E13  .

- Open “Settings” on your mobile and select "Lockscreen and Password".
- The lock system menu would appear if your device had no screen locks. If your device has a screen lock, you will have to enter the password to enter the settings.
- Select the "Lockscreen Password" option at the top and tap on the "Enable Lock Screen" button.
- Select the type of lock you want to set and create a password.

### 3: How to Remove Them with Password or Pattern?

You can easily remove the lock screen of your Motorola Moto E13  if you remember your password or pattern.

- Go to “Settings” and follow the previous steps to open the "Lockscreen Password" settings.
- Disable the lock screen by tapping on the "Enable Lock Screen" button once.
- Enter your password or pattern and wait for the system to remove the screen lock.

### 1: Google Find My Device

You can use the Google Find My Device for your **Motorola Moto E13  pattern unlock**. It is a simple privacy and security Google feature that enables users to reset their android phones. Most people use it to factory reset their phones when someone steals their phones. Although Google Find My Device works every time, it is not the ideal solution if you don't want to lose your data. With a hard reset, you lose all your data and settings. It is not worth it if all you want to do is unlock your screen. Here are the steps to unlock Motorola Moto E13  with Find My Device.

### 4: Hard Reset (data loss)

A hard reset would be the best solution if you forgot your phone's lock screen password or pattern. However, you can unlock your phone with your Google account as well. Do a hard reset if you can't remember your Google account password and don't want to use third-party tools. The only problem with hard resetting is that you lose all your data, images, files, settings, and personalization. That is why you can't recover any of your data after the hard reset if you don't have a data backup. The process of hard reset is different for every device. Here are the steps for **Motorola Moto E13  pattern unlock without a PC** through a hard reset.

- Switch off your Motorola Moto E13  with the power button.

![power key](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/oppo-a37-password-unlock-04.jpg)

- Press and hold the Volume down + Power buttons together for a few seconds. Hold the keys until you see the Motorola  logo on the screen.
