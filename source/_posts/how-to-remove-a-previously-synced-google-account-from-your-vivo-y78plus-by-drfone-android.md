- **Step 2**: Sign in with your Google account, which you used on your locked Vivo phone.
- **Step 3**: The Android Device Manager dashboard will show your locked Vivo with three options: Ring, Lock, and Erase.
- **Step 4**: Simply click on "Lock".
- **Step 5**: Enter a password that is not your Google account password in the "New Password" field.

- **Step 8**: Enter another phone number in the "Phone number" field, although this is optional.
- **Step 9**: Choose "Lock" after entering your password and filling out the optional fields if you wish.
