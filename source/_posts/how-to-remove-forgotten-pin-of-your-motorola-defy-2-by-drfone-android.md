### 1: Lock Types

Before we move towards the **Motorola Defy 2  pattern unlock**, let's talk about its lock types and security system. Motorola Defy 2  is one of the older versions of Motorola  android phones that was released in 2016. At that time, only flagship phones from each brand came with features like fingerprint sensors and facial unlock. Motorola Defy 2  doesn't offer these lock types. You can only set up a screen lock as a password, pattern, and PIN. You can also lock apps on Motorola Defy 2  with its privacy password settings.

You will see various questions if your Google account is linked with the Motorola Defy 2 device. All questions are based on your profile and credentials. You have to answer precisely with proper spaces. Here are the steps to unlock Motorola Defy 2  with security questions.

### 4: Hard Reset (data loss)

A hard reset would be the best solution if you forgot your phone's lock screen password or pattern. However, you can unlock your phone with your Google account as well. Do a hard reset if you can't remember your Google account password and don't want to use third-party tools. The only problem with hard resetting is that you lose all your data, images, files, settings, and personalization. That is why you can't recover any of your data after the hard reset if you don't have a data backup. The process of hard reset is different for every device. Here are the steps for **Motorola Defy 2  pattern unlock without a PC** through a hard reset.

- Switch off your Motorola Defy 2  with the power button.
