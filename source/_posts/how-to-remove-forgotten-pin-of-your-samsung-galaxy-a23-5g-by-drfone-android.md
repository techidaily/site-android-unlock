### Way 2. Removing Google Smart Lock From Android Settings

Google Smart Lock enables users to keep their phones unlocked under specific, pre-approved, and secure conditions. This simplifies device usage by eliminating the need to input passwords or security codes. The basic working of this aspect of Google Smart Lock, now known as “Extend Unlock,” is divided into three parts.

The first one is on-body detection, which keeps the Samsung Galaxy A23 5G device unlocked when it's carried or held by the user. The other two are “Trusted Places” and “Trusted Devices.” Users can set specific locations, like home or work, as "Trusted Places." When the Samsung Galaxy A23 5G device is within these locations, it remains unlocked and accessible. Smart Lock integrates biometric authentication methods to unlock devices.

As helpful as it is in managing access to your Android device, privacy concerns can cause users to disable this lock. The following are the steps you can **take to disable Google Smart Lock**/Extend Unlock via Android settings:

- **Step 1.** Access “Settings” on your Android device and scroll down to tap "Passwords & security." Here, press the option labeled as "Privacy."

![navigate to android privacy settings](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/guide-to-remove-or-disable-google-smart-lock-4.jpg)

- **Step 2.** On the following screen, head to the "Trust agents" option and toggle off the "Smart Lock (Google)" option to disable the feature on your device.
