### 4\. Dirty Phone or Sensor

#### Solution

##### 1\. Cleaning the Phone

Employ a gentle, dry microfiber cloth for wiping down the complete surface of your Pixel device. Take particular care to thoroughly clean the region surrounding the fingerprint sensor.

### 5\. Screen Protector: Dirty or Damaged

#### Problem

A smudged or impaired screen protector might disrupt the working of the fingerprint sensor. This can potentially cause it to fail to recognize your fingerprint.

#### Solution

##### 1\. Clean the Screen Protector

Start by effectively cleaning the screen protector on your Pixel device. For a thorough cleaning, consider utilizing a screen cleaning solution. Ensure that the screen protector is free from any dirt or debris.

##### 2\. Replace Damaged Protectors

Is the screen protector visibly damaged, scratched, or peeling off? If yes, consider replacing it with a new one. Damaged protectors can hinder fingerprint recognition and compromise device protection.

##### 3\. Check Compatibility

Ensure the screen protector is designed to be compatible with fingerprint sensors. Some protectors may obstruct or interfere with the sensor's functionality.

#### Solution

##### 1\. Cleanse and Dry Your Hands

Remove any dirt, oil, or moisture that might cause issues with the fingerprint sensor. It's crucial to wash and thoroughly dry your hands. Additionally, verify that your fingers are entirely dry before engaging the sensor. The reason is any moisture or dampness may cause inaccuracies in fingerprint identification.

##### 2\. Avoid Oily or Greasy Substances
