The service allows IT administrators to pre-configure settings and apps and manage other aspects of the Motorola Moto G84 5G device’s functionality. When a device is enrolled, it can be remotely controlled and monitored.

## Part 2: How To Remove Knox Enrollment Service on Your Motorola Moto G84 5G

Be aware that this option might not be available on all devices, depending on how Knox was configured.

### Rooting and Flashing a New ROM To Remove Knox Enrollment Service

For the more tech-savvy users, another method to **bypass Knox Enrollment Service** is by rooting the Motorola Moto G84 5G device and flashing a new ROM. This process involves gaining root access to the Motorola Moto G84 5G device’s operating system, which allows you to modify the software extensively. After rooting, you can flash a new ROM that doesn’t include the Knox software.

However, this method is risky and not recommended for the average user. It will void your warranty and potentially ‘brick’ your device, rendering it unusable. Furthermore, this action could notify your employer of your attempt to remove Knox, which could have professional repercussions. Proceed with this method only if you know the risks and consequences.

**Removing Knox Enrollment Service** from your phone is feasible but requires careful consideration, especially in a corporate context. Always ensure you have the necessary permissions and understand the risks of modifying your device’s software.
