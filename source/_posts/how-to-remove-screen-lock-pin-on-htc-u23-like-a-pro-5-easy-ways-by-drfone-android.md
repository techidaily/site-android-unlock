When you go to Settings > Lock Screen > Screen lock type, several lock screen options are available. These options are given below:

**Swipe:**

You can unlock your phone by swiping in any direction on its screen.

**Pattern:**

You will draw a pattern on a 3-by-3 grid of dots to unlock your phone this way. To do this, you'll need to use your finger to connect the dots in the pattern.

**Phone Pin:**

When you choose a PIN, make sure it's something easy to remember. But choose wisely- a PIN that's too easy to guess can put your account at risk.

**Password:**

It is the highest level of security available for your phone. Passwords should contain seven characters, of which at least one must be a letter. They should also be both unique and memorable.

By holding your face directly in front of the phone screen, you can unlock your phone and verify yourself in apps.

**Fingerprints:**

Touch your phone to open it quickly and easily.

**Iris:**

Verify that only the contents of your phone are visible to your eyes.

**Intelligent Scan:**
