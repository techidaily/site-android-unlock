## How to Bypass Android Lock Screen Using Emergency Call On Motorola Moto G14?

The main reason why we keep our smartphone locked is to prevent children (or stalkers) checking out our private photos or messages. You don't want anyone to access your pictures, emails, or other important data. What if you forget your pattern or PIN and cannot access your phone? Or someone changes lock screen pattern to leave you annoyed?

To avoid such types of conditions, we have tried and tested the following methods to bypass the Motorola lock screen pattern, PIN, password, and fingerprint.

## Method 1. Use 'Find My Mobile' feature on Motorola Phone

- Step 2. Click the "Lock My Screen" button.
- Step 3. Enter a new PIN in the first field
- Step 4. Click the "Lock" button at the bottom
- Step 5. Within a few minutes, it will change the lock screen password to the PIN so that you can unlock your device.

SD card is required to move a ZIP file to the phone, and it is the only way to transfer the file when the Motorola Moto G14 device is locked.

- Step 1. Download a zip file named "Pattern Password Disable" on your computer and move it to the SD card of your Motorola device.
