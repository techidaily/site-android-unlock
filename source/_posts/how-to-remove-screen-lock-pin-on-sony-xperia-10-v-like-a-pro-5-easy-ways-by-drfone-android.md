Regardless of which method you use, you will be able to unlock your phone! So, let’s get started!

## 1\. How to Unlock Sony Xperia 10 V  With Google Find My Sony Xperia 10 V?

A way to unlock the Sony Xperia 10 V  phone is via Google Find My Device feature. While this method can help unlock your phone, it erases all content from it.

For this method, you need a PC and your Google account details. Here are the steps for it:

**Step 1:** Open your browser and go to [Google Find My Device](https://www.google.com/android/find) on your PC.

**Step 2:** Log in to the Google account you used to set up your Sony Xperia 10 V  phone.

**Step 3:** It will show you 3 options: Play Sound, Secure Device, and Erase Device.

![find my device](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/05/google-find-my-device.jpg)

 And then select “**Erase Device.**”

![select erase data](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/05/select-erase-device.jpg)

Selecting this option will erase all content from your device, including screen unlock PIN, password, and pattern.

**Step 4:** Now, you can access your phone without an unlock PIN or pattern and set a new one.

Use this method only if your phone is backed up so you can restore all your data later.

Another foolproof method on how to unlock Android pattern lock is by using a lock removal tool like [Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (Android)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare-dr-fone-unlock-android-screen/).

## How to Remove Operator Lock on Sony Xperia 10 V ?

An operator lock, also called a carrier lock, constitutes a limitation imposed on a mobile phone by a network provider. This measure is implemented to guarantee that the Sony Xperia 10 V device exclusively functions with the services provided by that specific carrier. If you wish to remove the operator lock from your Sony Xperia 10 V  device, you'll need to follow specific steps and meet certain criteria. Here's how to remove the operator lock on a Sony Xperia 10 V :

**Step 1:** Begin by checking whether your device can be unlocked or not from its network carrier restrictions. To do that, you need to dial the code “\*#\*#7378423#\*#\*” on your device, tap “Service Info” and select “SIM Lock.”
