Regardless of which method you use, you will be able to unlock your phone! So, let’s get started!

## 1\. How to Unlock Sony Xperia 10 V  With Google Find My Sony Xperia 10 V?

A way to unlock the Sony Xperia 10 V  phone is via Google Find My Device feature. While this method can help unlock your phone, it erases all content from it.

For this method, you need a PC and your Google account details. Here are the steps for it:

**Step 1:** Open your browser and go to [Google Find My Device](https://www.google.com/android/find) on your PC.

**Step 2:** Log in to the Google account you used to set up your Sony Xperia 10 V  phone.

**Step 3:** It will show you 3 options: Play Sound, Secure Device, and Erase Device.

![find my device](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/05/google-find-my-device.jpg)

 And then select “**Erase Device.**”

![select erase data](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/05/select-erase-device.jpg)

Selecting this option will erase all content from your device, including screen unlock PIN, password, and pattern.

**Step 4:** Now, you can access your phone without an unlock PIN or pattern and set a new one.

Use this method only if your phone is backed up so you can restore all your data later.

## How to Remove Operator Lock on Sony Xperia 10 V ?

An operator lock, also called a carrier lock, constitutes a limitation imposed on a mobile phone by a network provider. This measure is implemented to guarantee that the Sony Xperia 10 V device exclusively functions with the services provided by that specific carrier. If you wish to remove the operator lock from your Sony Xperia 10 V  device, you'll need to follow specific steps and meet certain criteria. Here's how to remove the operator lock on a Sony Xperia 10 V :

**Step 1:** Begin by checking whether your device can be unlocked or not from its network carrier restrictions. To do that, you need to dial the code “\*#\*#7378423#\*#\*” on your device, tap “Service Info” and select “SIM Lock.”
