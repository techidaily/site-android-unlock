## How to Unlock a Network Locked Samsung Galaxy A23 5G Phone?

Revolutions in the telecommunication industry have introduced advancements in smartphone features and utilities. The other side of the coin is, however, not as appealing. Thanks to the different carrier services, network locking is the commonest issue of recent mobile launches. Users have reported of Samsung Galaxy A23 5G phones refusing to work with different carriers.

The issue limits the smartphone's functioning to the specific carrier from whom the Samsung Galaxy A23 5G device is purchased. Consequently, there are annoying connectivity problems that restrict seamless mobile usage. The problem aggravates in geo-restricted regions where the carrier options are quite limited. This scenario puts forward the need for **Samsung Galaxy A23 5G network unlock** solutions.

## Part 1: What Does It Mean When Your Samsung Galaxy A23 5G Phone is Network Locked?

In the simplest words, a network-locked Samsung Galaxy A23 5G phone means that your device has become carrier-specific. It will now work only with the network provider from where the phone was purchased. Another problem is that there is no automatic unlocking even after the expiry of your contract with the carrier service. Having a network-locked Samsung Galaxy A23 5G phone poses undesired connectivity issues.

### 1\. Why is my phone locked to the network carrier?

Smartphones are network locked by carrier services to prevent customers from switching to a different carrier. Reasons for switching can be the availability of better plans, discounts, etc. Another cause of locking the phones to specific carriers is preventing them from theft and unauthorized usage.

![voicemail](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/how-to-reset-voicemail-password-on-android-1.jpg)

### 1\. Contact your carrier

Your carrier can also unlock your voicemail. Get in touch with your carrier and ask for an unlock. For unlocking, your account may need to satisfy certain conditions. The request can take a few days to be processed after you submit it.

Get in touch with your carrier to find out the status of your unlock request.

The actions following should be followed when your carrier certifies that the voicemail has been reset.

- Take your SIM card out.
- Put the new SIM card in. Your gadget will turn on, and you will be able to generate a new voicemail password.

### 2\. Use your code to reset password

To change your Voicemail password, use star codes. Fortunately, this process is quick and easy, and you won't need to contact customer care to change your password.

Use the star code as follows:

- Type #793# into the dialer app on your phone.
- Press the Call key.
- Await the instructions.

This will change your voicemail password to your phone's last four digits.

You can also reset your voicemail password, which means that you can generate a new code by resetting it from the settings. Let's have a look at how you can do this.

- Open My Wireless from your account summary.
- Select the Samsung Galaxy A23 5G device you wish to manage by scrolling to My Devices & Add-ons.
- Choosing Manage my device.
- Look under Device choices & settings, choose Reset voicemail password, then adhere to the on-screen instructions.

## Part 2: FAQs

### 1\. How To Know My Default Voicemail Password?

Depending on your carrier, the default voicemail password is either the last seven or final four digits of your phone number. Your voicemails should be accessible if you dial the number without the area code. In this way, you can quickly get your default voicemail password.

### 2\. Can I Remove My Voicemail Password?

From your mobile device, dial 123 to see the password for your voicemail. To enable (add) or disable (delete) your voicemail password, choose option 4. To enable or disable the screen password, select option 1. If your password has been deactivated, dialing 123 will not ask you to enter one.

### 3\. How Can I Receive Voicemail Messages From Another Device?

You may access your mailbox on another phone if your phone is out of reach or the battery is dead. Make a call to your phone number from a different one. Tap the pound key (#) on the phone's dial pad after the prerecorded "Please leave a message" greeting has begun to play. Enter the pin from your voicemail to start receiving messages from another device.
