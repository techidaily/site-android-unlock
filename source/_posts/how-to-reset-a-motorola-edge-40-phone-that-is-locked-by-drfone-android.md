![Minimal adb and fastboot installation complete](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/06/14648313566582.jpg)

**Step 4.** Make sure your device is connected, then go to the Minimal ADB and Fastboot installation directory.

This PC \[Win 8& 10\] or My computer \[Windows 7 & below\]> Local Disk (C:) \[primary drive\]> Program Files \[for 32-bit\] or Program Files (x86) \[for 64-bit\] > Minimal ADB and Fasboot.

![Local Disk](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/06/14648313589887.jpg)

![Program Files (x86) folder](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/06/14648313591963.jpg)

![Minimal adb and fastboot folder](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/06/14648313625020.jpg)

**Step 5.** Inside the folder, hold the Shift key on your keyboard, then right-click your mouse. An additional "Open command window here" will appear so select that.

![Minimal adb and fastboot open command](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/06/14648313653169.jpg)

**Step 6.** ADB terminal will pop out. Now, the first is to type in ADB _devices_. This is to check if your device is recognized by ADB. If there is no device listed below, try to remove and reconnect your Motorola Edge 40 and retype the command. If there are listed devices already, proceed.

![Minimal adb and fastboot command window adb devices command](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/06/14648317691463.jpg)

**Step 7.** Finally, type in the following commands **one by one****.** These commands will remove your lock screen.

- _adb shell_
- _cd /data/data/com.android.providers.settings/databases_
- _sqlite3 settings.db_
- _update system set value=0 where_
- _name='lock\_pattern\_autolock';_
- _update system set value=0 where_
- _name='lockscreen.lockedoutpermanently';_
- _.quit_

![Minimal adb and fastboot adb shell command](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/06/14648317729484.jpg)

This would work if you have your USB debugging turned on before it was locked. That's how to unlock Android using ADB.

## Part 4: How to Unlock Phone via Find My Device (with Data Loss)

Google Find My Device is another handy way to unlock your locked Android device. However, it requires you to have your Google ID credentials and you have previously enabled Find My Device features. Moreover, it will erase all the data on your device. Use the following steps to unlock your Android phone via Find My Device:

**Step 1:** Open a web browser on a computer or another device and visit the Find My Device website. Now, sign in with the Google account that is linked to the locked Android device.

**Step 2:** After signing in, you will see a list of devices associated with your Google account on the left side of the screen. Select the locked Android device from the list and choose the "Erase Device" option from the menu on the left-hand side.

![tap on erase device option](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/09/unlock-android-phone-1.jpg)

**Step 3:** You will now be asked to confirm your identity through a Google account password or using a pass-key. Afterward, follow the on-screen instructions to erase and unlock your Android device.

## Part 5: How to Unlock Android Phone without Losing Data in Safe Mode

One way to unlock your Android phone without losing the data is by utilizing Safe Mode. This method works only if the screen lock you have been using is a third-party app. Since Safe Mode disables third-party apps, you can easily use it to uninstall the problematic app. Here is **how to unlock an Android phone without losing data**:

**Step 1:** On your Android device, press and hold “Power” and “Volume Down” keys together for 3 seconds. After the Power menu becomes visible, press and hold the “Power off” option.

**Step 2:** After a while, you will see the "Safe Mode" option on your screen with some basic instructions. Now, you can use the button to boot into Safe Mode and remove the screen lock application.

## Part 6. How to Unlock Android Phone without Any Data Loss Using Google Account (Android 4.4 or lower)

If luckily, you left your Wi-Fi open and luckily connected to the internet, this is the easiest way to unlock your Android phone.

**The step-by-step guide for you to refer**

**Step 1:** Retry the incorrect password or pattern until the ''Forgotten Password/Pattern'' appears below. Then select that.

![android forgot pattern lock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/06/14648495587136.jpg)

**Step 2:** Check ''Enter your Google Account details'' then tap next.

![Unlock screen enter google account details](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/06/14648495698424.jpg)

**Step 3:** Input your Google Account details, username, and password. You are done.

![Account unlock Google](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/06/14648495811338.jpg)

You will be given the option to input a new password or pattern right after you enter your Google account details. But if not, Google must have emailed you your temporary password or pattern that you will input to unlock your lock screen.
