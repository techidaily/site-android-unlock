### Using Google Account Details

Almost all Android smartphones, including Meizu 21 Pro , require you to enter your Google account details when setting up your phone for the first time. This account comes in handy later on in situations where your phone is lost or stolen or if you’re switching to another phone. However, it can also help with basic issues like unlocking your phone in case you forget your Meizu 21 Pro  screen unlock PIN, pattern, or password. But to use this method successfully, you need to remember the email address bound to the Meizu 21 Pro device and its password.

Here's how to unlock the Meizu 21 Pro  pattern lock without losing data using your Google account:

- **Step 1:** Enter the incorrect PIN, pattern, or password 5 times, and click on “Forgot Password” or “Forgot Pattern.”
- **Step 2:** The interface will then ask you to enter your Google account details as an alternate option. Enter the Google account details you used when setting up your Meizu 21 Pro  phone.
- **Step 3:** This will unlock your phone. You can now reset the screen unlock PIN, password, or pattern.

If you don't remember your Google account details, you can still unlock your Meizu 21 Pro  phone using a third-party tool.

### Using Security Question

Another way to unlock your Meizu 21 Pro  phone using Google is by answering the security question. When we set up our Google account, we usually choose a security question and an answer.

For the latter, here are the steps:

- **Step 1:** Enter the incorrect PIN or pattern to unlock your screen several times till you see the “Forgot Pattern” or “Forgot Password” option. Click on it.
- **Step 2:** Now select the “Answer Security Question” option and type in the answer.
- **Step 3:** Click on “Unlock” after which you will be asked if you want to set a new PIN or pattern. Select “Yes.”
- **Step 4:** Your Meizu 21 Pro  phone will be unlocked, and you can set a new PIN or pattern for your screen.

## How to Unlock Meizu 21 Pro  by Hard Reset?

Hard resetting your smartphone usually solves everything! Hence, it can also help you unlock your Meizu 21 Pro  phone; however, using this method will erase all the data on your phone. So, if you still want to unlock Meizu 21 Pro  phone using this method, only do so if you have backed up your device and have no other way to unlock your phone. This includes forgetting your Google account details or not having access to a PC to download and use Dr Fone - Screen Unlock (Android).

Here are the steps for it:

- **Step 1:** Power off your Meizu 21 Pro  phone.
- **Step 2:** Press and hold the power and volume down button until the Sony screen appears.
- **Step 3:** The “System Recovery” menu will appear. Use the volume up and down button to scroll to the “Factory Reset” option. Use the power button to select this option.
- **Step 4:** Select “Yes” when asked for confirmation.

Your Meizu 21 Pro  phone will be hard reset, and all the locks will be removed. When you turn it on again, you will have to set it up like a new phone using your Google account details.

## How to Remove Operator Lock on Meizu 21 Pro ?

An operator lock, also called a carrier lock, constitutes a limitation imposed on a mobile phone by a network provider. This measure is implemented to guarantee that the Meizu 21 Pro device exclusively functions with the services provided by that specific carrier. If you wish to remove the operator lock from your Meizu 21 Pro  device, you'll need to follow specific steps and meet certain criteria. Here's how to remove the operator lock on a Meizu 21 Pro :

**Step 1:** Begin by checking whether your device can be unlocked or not from its network carrier restrictions. To do that, you need to dial the code “\*#\*#7378423#\*#\*” on your device, tap “Service Info” and select “SIM Lock.”

![dial the provided number](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/10/unlock-sony-xperia-pin-code-5.jpg)

**Step 2:** Carefully check the information provided on the screen. If there is "X" before the "Network" option and the number in front of it is larger than 0, it means your device can be unlocked. If the number in front of "Network" is 0, your device can't be unlocked as it is hard-locked.

![check the network status](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/10/unlock-sony-xperia-pin-code-6.jpg)

**Step 3:** The next step involves getting your device’s IMEI number. To accomplish this task, simply input "\*#06#" on your device. Once you have the IMEI number, use a reliable service from the internet to the unlocking code. Insert the SIM card of another network and provide the code you gained to unlock your Meizu 21 Pro  device.

## Bonus Tip: How to Unlock Bootloader?

Unlocking the bootloader on your Android device provides significant advantages. These actions encompass obtaining root access, installing custom ROMs, configuring custom recoveries, and carrying out advanced procedures. Here's an essential guide on unlocking the bootloader of your Sony device while keeping all precautions in mind:

**Step 1:** To start with the process, verify the bootloader status for your Sony smartphone. On opening the "Dialer" app, dial the number "\*#\*#7378423#\*#\*" and access the "Rooting Status" option within the "Service Provider" settings.

**Step 2:** If the bootloader status displays "Yes," ensure that the Sony USB drivers and ADB tools are installed on your computer. Enable "USB Debugging" and "OEM Unlocking" on your smartphone and switch it off.

**Step 3:** Connect the Meizu 21 Pro  smartphone with a USB cable and press the "Power + Volume Up" keys for a few seconds. Open the Windows computer and access the "Devices and Printers" directory. Right-click on the "fastboot driver" file, select "Update," and select the location of the "android\_winbus.inf" file. Verify the fastboot connectivity through the CMD command.

**Step 4:** Open the official “Sony Unlocking Site” and add in the IMEI number. On acknowledging, use the commands as follows: `adb reboot bootloader`

Unlock the bootloader with the following command: `fastboot oem unlock 0x<insert your unlock code`

Verify the bootloader is unlocked and use the command to reboot the system; if not done automatically: `fastboot reboot`
