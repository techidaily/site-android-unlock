Setting up a lock screen is a crucial step in protecting your phone's data. If you're not sure how to create one on your Androidâ„¢ phone, we're here to help.

You'll need to reset your Google Account password if you forget it or become locked out for some other reason when you try to keep accessing all of your data. You might also need to change lock screen passcode from time to time.
