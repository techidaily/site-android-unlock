![disabling google smart lock feature](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/guide-to-remove-or-disable-google-smart-lock-1.jpg)

## Part 1. Understanding Google Smart Lock and How It Works?

Want to know **what is Google Smart Lock**? [Google Smart Lock](https://get.google.com/smartlock/) serves as a multi-purpose tool within the Google ecosystem. It is designed to streamline security measures and password management access across platforms. At its core, Google Smart Lock operates as a feature that manages passwords. Google Smart Lock aims to enhance authentication processes. Primarily, it operates across Android devices and computers.

It offers a unified approach to security, ensuring you don’t have to remember all the passwords. Google Smart Lock securely stores and manages passwords for websites and apps. It enables users to access these services without repeatedly entering login details. When you visit a familiar website or app, Google Smart Lock fills in the login credentials. It automatically provides the login ID and password, maintaining effortless access.

## Part 2. Recognizing Some Top Features of Google Smart Lock

Google Smart Lock’s password management has revolutionized how users handle and secure their login credentials. It remains a cornerstone when handling Android devices and computer systems. The following are several notable features that significantly enhance user convenience and security:

### 1\. Password Autofill

Google Smart Lock simplifies the login process across apps and websites. It does that by automatically filling in saved credentials. This eliminates the need for users to remember and manually input passwords.

### 2\. Cross-Platform Synchronization

It synchronizes saved passwords across multiple devices using the same Google account. This ensures smooth access to credentials on Android devices and computers.

### 3\. Secure Storage

Passwords stored within Google Smart Lock are encrypted and securely stored in the user's Google account. This maintains confidentiality and safeguards sensitive login information.

### 4\. Effortless Password Generation

It allows the creation of strong and unique passwords when signing up for new accounts. That enhances overall account security and allows users to have strong passwords.

These features significantly ease the burden of password management and enhance user security. Yet, **Google Smart Lock** does have limitations that prompt some users to consider removing it.

## Part 3. Why Is It Essential To Remove Google Smart Lock?

Despite its array of benefits, there are times when users consider removing or disabling Google Smart Lock. Described below are these limitations to better grasp why users might choose to **Google Smart Lock turn off**:

### 1\. Privacy Concerns

Some users focus on privacy and feel uncomfortable with Google Smart Lock's access to their passwords. The reason behind this is how easily anyone can access the saved password. All they need to do is access "Manage Passwords" in Google Chrome, and all their passwords will be open. This leads them to opt for more private password management options.

### 2\. Glitches and Technical Issues

Technical glitches in the functioning of Google Smart Lock can be frustrating. This is especially prominent when managing passwords with similar usernames across different websites. The same can happen when using similar passwords for different websites or apps. Users experiencing such issues can seek to remove it to restore regular operations.

### 3\. No Updates

You should be aware that Google Smart Lock for Passwords has been deprecated. This indicates it no longer receives updates or support from Google. Developers are advised to opt for Google's One Tap Sign-in feature as an alternative by Google. It provides a more efficient and secure method for signing in to apps and websites.

### 4\. Preference for Third-Party Tools

Certain users might have a preference for specialized third-party password management tools. They can go for solutions that offer a wider array of features. Many users might want to find options better aligned with their specific needs. This prompts them to disable Google Smart Lock.

## Part 4. Understanding Some Effective Ways To Disable or Remove Google Smart Lock

### Way 2. Removing Google Smart Lock From Android Settings

Google Smart Lock enables users to keep their phones unlocked under specific, pre-approved, and secure conditions. This simplifies device usage by eliminating the need to input passwords or security codes. The basic working of this aspect of Google Smart Lock, now known as “Extend Unlock,” is divided into three parts.

The first one is on-body detection, which keeps the Lava Yuva 3 Pro device unlocked when it's carried or held by the user. The other two are “Trusted Places” and “Trusted Devices.” Users can set specific locations, like home or work, as "Trusted Places." When the Lava Yuva 3 Pro device is within these locations, it remains unlocked and accessible. Smart Lock integrates biometric authentication methods to unlock devices.

As helpful as it is in managing access to your Android device, privacy concerns can cause users to disable this lock. The following are the steps you can **take to disable Google Smart Lock**/Extend Unlock via Android settings:

- **Step 1.** Access “Settings” on your Android device and scroll down to tap "Passwords & security." Here, press the option labeled as "Privacy."
