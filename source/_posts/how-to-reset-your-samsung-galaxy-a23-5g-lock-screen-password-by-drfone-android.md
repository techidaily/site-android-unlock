## Bonus Part: Useful Tips to Prevent Future Lockouts on Android

Here are some helpful tips to prevent future lockouts on your Android device and ensure better password management.

- **1\. Use Password Managers**: Consider using reputable password manager apps that securely store and manage your passwords. These apps often have features to generate strong, unique passwords for different accounts and help you remember them.
- **2\. Set up Biometric Authentication**: In case your device supports it, use biometric authentication methods for a better experience. These can be fingerprints or facial recognition. These methods can be more convenient than remembering passwords and offer added security.
- **3\. Create Memorable Passwords**: If you opt against using a password manager, craft robust yet easily remembered passwords. To improve your security, try to use a sequence of lowercase and uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols. Plus, avoid easily guessable details like birthdays or common phrases to make your password strong.
- **4\. Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**: Enable two-factor authentication whenever possible for your accounts. Likewise, this provides an added layer of security by requiring a secondary verification method. It could be a text message code or authentication app in addition to your password.
- **5\. Regularly Back Up Your Data**: Make it a habit to consistently [back up your device data](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/android-backup-and-restore/). To prevent potential data loss from forgotten passwords or unexpected issues, take precautions. Safeguard your crucial data by creating backups, whether in the cloud or on an external storage device.

_Using the Android Device Manager to track a lost phone_


## Part 1: What is Android Device Manager lock?

Android Device Manager is Google’s take on Apple’s Find My iPhone. Enabling the ADM is quite easy; just go to google.com/android/devicemanager  on your computer and search through your list of devices that are already connected to your Google account. Once you are there, you can easily send a notification to the phone you want to enable remote password application and wiping upon.

ADM comes with a set of features that helps you to unlock your Android phone as well. It not only helps you to find your device, but also Ring it, lock it, and wipe and erase all the data as well, if your phone is lost or stolen. Once you’re logged into the ADM website from your computer, you can avail all these options once your phone is located. It is a wise option to get your device locked by Android Device Manager in case it is lost or stolen, so that your phone is secured.

Android Device Manager can unlock your phone under a specific set of circumstances only.

- • First of all, Android Device Manager needs to be enabled on your phone before it is lost, stolen, etc.
- • Secondly, your phone can only be tracked by ADM if the GPS option is switched on.
- • Thirdly, the Samsung Galaxy A23 5G device you are using for ADM, must be connected to Wi-Fi or internet, to login to your Google account.
- • Lastly, Android Device Manager is not compatible for all Android versions. For now, it is only compatible with devices running Android 4.4 and above, so your phone must be in this category for ADM to work.

## Part 2: How to unlock Android phone with Android Device Manager?

Just act according to the following steps, and the Android Device Manager will unlock your phone.

1\. On your computer or any other mobile phone, visit: google.com/android/devicemanager

2\. Then, sign in with the help of your Google login details that you had used in your locked phone as well.

3\. In the ADM interface, choose the Samsung Galaxy A23 5G device you want to unlock. Now, select “Lock”.

The Android Device Manager has successfully unlocked your phone!

A downside to this process, is an error message faced by some users while using ADM. Many users have reported the issue, that when they have tried using ADM to unlock their locked device, an error message has occurred, saying, “since Google has verified that a screen lock is already set”. Basically, this error message conveys that you will not be able to unlock your phone using Android Device Manager, and this is a flaw on Google’s part, not your phone’s.

## Part 3: What to do if phone is locked by Android Device Manager

There are 2 situations where you would want to know how to unlock the Android Device Manager lock – one, when you have unfortunately forgotten the screen lock passcode and the other is when your phone is locked by Android Device Manager.

ADM is built to completely lock your device so that unknown people cannot access it. So, if your phone is locked by Android Device Manager, you might be in a problem.While ADM is a wonderful tool to lock your phone or erase and wipe data if its stolen or lost, most of the users have reported the issue that they cannot unlock their phones that are locked by Android Device Manager. A possible solution to this is adding a temporary password via Google login and bypassing the ADM lock. Or, you can try resetting the password again by entering a new password via ADM. If that does not work, you can make use of several third-party applications which can be found in the internet, that will help to completely erase the Android Device Manager lock.

So, now you know how to unlock the Android Device Manager lock. Do keep in mind, your device must be connected to internet or Wi-Fi, to login to your Google account.
