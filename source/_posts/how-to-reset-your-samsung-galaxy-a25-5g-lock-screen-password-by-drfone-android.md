## Bonus Part: Useful Tips to Prevent Future Lockouts on Android

Here are some helpful tips to prevent future lockouts on your Android device and ensure better password management.

- **1\. Use Password Managers**: Consider using reputable password manager apps that securely store and manage your passwords. These apps often have features to generate strong, unique passwords for different accounts and help you remember them.
- **2\. Set up Biometric Authentication**: In case your device supports it, use biometric authentication methods for a better experience. These can be fingerprints or facial recognition. These methods can be more convenient than remembering passwords and offer added security.
- **3\. Create Memorable Passwords**: If you opt against using a password manager, craft robust yet easily remembered passwords. To improve your security, try to use a sequence of lowercase and uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols. Plus, avoid easily guessable details like birthdays or common phrases to make your password strong.
- **4\. Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**: Enable two-factor authentication whenever possible for your accounts. Likewise, this provides an added layer of security by requiring a secondary verification method. It could be a text message code or authentication app in addition to your password.
- **5\. Regularly Back Up Your Data**: Make it a habit to consistently [back up your device data](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/android-backup-and-restore/). To prevent potential data loss from forgotten passwords or unexpected issues, take precautions. Safeguard your crucial data by creating backups, whether in the cloud or on an external storage device.

To bypass the FRP lock on your ZTE, Motorola, and Samsung device, there is also an online service called UnlockJunky.com that claims to remove the FRP lock and previously linked account on your Android device within 5-15 minutes. This is a paid service that also claims that if they are unable to remove the lock, they will refund the amount to their customers.

**Step 3:** Now you need to initiate the order by providing the details asked and completing the payment.

**Step 4:** Next, the software needs to be downloaded and installed on your system, and using a USB cable, connect your phone to your computer.

**Step 5:** Connect with one of the support provider members through the live chat and they will help you remove the FRP lock on your Android phone.

With the steps above, you can remove the account **previously synced on this device**.

**Limitations of using the Unlockjunky method**:

- This is a paid service.
- Works only with Motorola, ZTE, and Samsung devices.
- There is no surety that the service will work for removing the FRP lock on your devices.
- If you have to remove the FRP lock from multiple devices, a separate payment for each device has to be done.
