## Part 1: Show Wifi Password on Rooted Android Device

### What is Rooting?

First of all, what does rooting mean? You have probably used a Windows computer or even Linux. For the case of Windows, when installing a new program or software, it always prompts a dialog box saying, "Administrator permission required to run this program." If you don't have the administrator permission, you won't install the program. In Android, this is called rooting. In simple terms, it means having the root permission to your phone. Some Android apps will require you the root permission, e.g., flashing your ROM. In this part, we will explain how you can show the Wi-Fi password on your Android with root.

To find the Wi-Fi passwords on your Android phone, you need to have an app to explore files which also supports a root user. In this case, ES FileExplorer or Root Explorer will come in handy. However, it turns out that the latter is offered at $3. Let's use the free ES File Explorer.

![android show wifi password](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14556285763404.jpg)

### Steps of getting Wi-Fi password on Android with root

In only four steps, we, at this moment, learn how we can find the password of a Wi-Fi on an Android phone.

Step 1: Install the ES File Explorer

Download the ES File Explorer from your play store, install it, and open it.

![android show wifi password](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14556286507084.jpg)

Step 2: Enable Root Explorer

The root explorer needs to be enabled so that you can reach the root folders of the Wi-Fi passwords you need. By default, the root feature in this ES explorer is not enabled. To enable it, just tap on the list menu on the top left corner.:

![android show wifi password](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14556292611536.jpg)

This will drop down a list of controls. Scroll down and find the **Root Explorer** option and enable it.

![android show wifi password](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14556293052566.jpg)

Step 3: Get the passwords' file.

Go back to ES file explorer, and this time, find the folder named **data**.

![android show wifi password](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14556293412707.jpg)

When this folder opens, find another one named **misc**. Open it and find another one named **wifi**. Here, find a file named **wpa\_supplicant.conf**.

![android show wifi password](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14556293762552.jpg)

Step 4: Retrieve the wifi password on Android

Make sure that you don't edit anything in the file. You might mess up with important data and fail to access the Wi-Fi(s) in the future.

![android show wifi password](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14556294042257.jpg)

As you can see above, we have found the Wi-Fi passwords on the android device. On each network profile, we have the name of the network represented by _name (ssid="{the name}")_, the network's password represented by _psk_, the network's access point represented by _key\_mgmt=WPA-PSK_ and its priority represented by _priority_.

## Part 2: Show Wifi Password on Android without Root

What if I don't have root access to my Android, can I still see Android Wi-Fi password? The short answer is yes. However, this is a bit involving but simple. You don't need to be a computer guru to do it, but you need to have a computer and some internet access of course. The key thing is to find a way through which we can fetch the password file from the phone without using a root access protocol in the Android. This is made possible by some little programming insight using the Windows Command prompt.

### Steps to show Wi-Fi password on Android without root

Step 1: Access the Developer authority

To access the files that Android uses to run passwords, you must first become a developer. This is very simple.

Get your Android phone and go to settings. Scroll down and find "About phone." Tap on it and scroll down again to find Build number.

![android show wifi password](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14556302638925.jpg)

Tap on this "build number" 5 to 6 times until a message pops up, saying, "You are now a developer".

![android show wifi password](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14556303263992.jpg)

Step 2: Enable the debugging.

Go back to Settings. Scroll down for developer options. Turn on the button for "Android/USB debugging".

![android show wifi password](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14556308665697.jpg)

Step 3: Install ADB drivers.

Now, open your Windows desktop. Download and install ADB drivers. (Use this download link [adbdriver.com](http://adbdriver.com/)). You need to download and install platform tools (minimal ADB and fastboot) from [http://forum.xda-developers.com/...](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2317790) Now open the folder where you've installed the above tools. By default, it is in the Local disc _C\\windows\\system32\\platform\_tools_ location. However, you might want to locate them by searching on the windows search engine. You have to hold the Shift key and right-click inside the folder to click on"Open Command Window Here."

![android show wifi password](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14556329561742.jpg)

Step 4: Test the ADB

Here, we would like to test whether the ABD is working properly. To do this, connect your phone to the PC using a USB. In the command prompt, type **adb services** and then press enter. If it's working properly, you should see a device on this list.

![android show wifi password](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14556329984622.jpg)

Step 5: Find the Android wifi password.

Now, it is time to type the given command in the command prompt and type: _adb pull /data/misc/wifi/wpa\_supplicant.conf c:/wpa\_supplicant.conf_. This will fetch the file from your phone to the local disc C drive of the PC.

Step 6: Get the wifi passwords.

Lastly, open the file with a notepad, and there you go.

![android show wifi password](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14556331232772.jpg)

Now you learned how to show the wifi password on your Android device.



## How To Unlock Vivo V29 Phone Without Password?

Has your Android smartphone been locked, and are you having trouble unlocking it now because you have forgotten phone password? Looking for methods to remove the password from your Android phone without doing a factory reset?

If the answer is "YES," you've come to the correct spot.

Many people, including you, have had similar issues and wish to know how to unlock an Android phone without a password.

As a result, we have created some of the greatest guidelines or, you might say, top ways that may assist you in unlocking Android phones today, simply for you and countless other Android users.

## Part 1: Unlock Your Locked Screen Without Password By 6 Efficient Ways

### 1\. By your Google account

You can use your Google Account to unlock the Android phone password if, after several tries, you are still unable to do so without doing a factory reset.

You need to log into the Google account that is associated with the Vivo V29 device, then do the following:

- The unlock pattern may only be used five times before a notification telling you to try again in 30 seconds appears.
- "Forgot pattern" will show up at the bottom of the screen.

![unlock with security question](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/howt-to-unlock-your-phone-without-password-1.jpg)

- You must enter the Gmail account that is associated with the Vivo V29 device here before selecting "Next."

![answer the security question](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/howt-to-unlock-your-phone-without-password-2.jpg)

- That's it; from this point forward, you may enter any new PIN or pattern that you can recall to unlock your smartphone.

### 2\. Google Find My Device

Using your Google account is a superb method for finding the Vivo V29 device when lost or stolen.

In addition, it may be used to lock or ring your smartphone. You may have noticed that there are three options available when using this feature: "Ring," "Lock," and "Erase."

To bypass the Android lock screen, all you need to do is sign into the Vivo V29 device's associated Google account and then follow these steps:

- On any Android device or a computer, go to <www.google.com/android/find> and sign in using your Google account. Choose the Android smartphone you wish to unlock after that.
- After choosing the Vivo V29 device, select one of the three options, "lock," from the list.
- There will be a new pop-up window that you can use to change the Vivo V29 device password. Additionally, you can choose to add a phone number or recovery email.
- Confirm it immediately, then input the password you just established on your locked device.

![enter new password using google find my device](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/howt-to-unlock-your-phone-without-password-3.jpg)

Many Samsung customers have this issue, which prevents them from using their devices. Try using the "Find My Mobile" feature on your mobile if you wish to unlock it if you're a Samsung user. It would be helpful if you had a Samsung or Android model account.

After that, use Find My Device to unlock your Android phone without losing any data by following the instructions below:

![unlock samsung without data loss](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/howt-to-unlock-your-phone-without-password-4.jpg)

- Sign in with your Samsung account at findmymobile.samsung.com.
- Choose "Lock my screen" from the menu on the left, type a new PIN in the box given, and then click "LOCK."

![generating new pin using lock my screen](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/howt-to-unlock-your-phone-without-password-5.jpg)

Your smartphone will be unlocked, and the password will be changed to the new one after a brief delay.

### 3\. Use ADB (Android Debug Bridge)

Without a factory reset, Android phone passwords may also be unlocked using the Android Debug Bridge (ADB).

- You must first download ADB to your computer. Visit the Android developer's website at <https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb.html> to do this.
- Launch the installer after that to begin downloading crucial software for your machine.

![launch the adb installer to unlock android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/howt-to-unlock-your-phone-without-password-6.jpg)

- Here, you must use a USB cable to connect your Vivo V29 to the computer
- This will activate the developer option on your smartphone if you navigate to Settings > About Phone > and choose the "Build Number" option seven times.
- After that, activate USB debugging by going to Settings > Developer Options.

![activate USB debugging from settings](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/howt-to-unlock-your-phone-without-password-7.jpg)

- Launch the command prompt in the ADB installation directory after your device is connected to the system.
- Press enter after typing "ADB shell rm /data/system/gesture.key" into the command line.

![go to system and enter command line](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/howt-to-unlock-your-phone-without-password-8.jpg)

- Finally, just restart your smartphone and use it as normal.

### 4\. Hard reset (data loss)

Each brand has a unique method for hard resetting a locked Android device. The methods to factory reset locked Android devices from Samsung, LG, HTC, Sony, and Huawei are compiled here.

When your phone is locked, you may access the recovery menu of your phone using its physical keys and choose to hard reset the Vivo V29 device. Here's how to restore a locked phone to factory settings.

- Use the buttons to see the recovery menu.
- Press and hold the Volume Up and Side buttons simultaneously until you see the brand logo on the screen for Android devices without a Power/Bixby/Home button.
- Press and hold the Volume Up, Bixby, and Power buttons all at once if your smartphone has a Power button. Releasing them before a logo arises is advised.
- Use the Volume Down key to highlight Wipe data/factory reset when the Android system recovery option displays, then hit the Power/Bixby key to choose it.
- Allow a few seconds for the factory reset procedure to finish after selecting Yes, or Factory data reset. The phone will reboot once you pick the Reboot system. Now you may configure it as if it were a brand-new gadget.

![reboot the system and follow factory reset](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/howt-to-unlock-your-phone-without-password-9.jpg)

### 5\. Unlock from Forgot Pattern (android 4.4 or lower)

This is another choice that might assist you in unlocking your phone without a factory reset or password. You may have observed that when pattern lock was enabled on your device, a security PIN question was also prompted at that time.

Therefore, you have the choice to Backup PIN, which might assist you in unlocking your smartphone, if you are unable to unlock it. To do it, take the following actions:
