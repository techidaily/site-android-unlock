## Part 1: Ways That Motorola Lets You Unlock Your Motorola Edge 40 Pro

Motorola Edge 40 Pro  are more than just smartphones; they are gateways to a personalized and secure user experience. To access the myriad of features these devices offer, Google provides several unlocking methods, ensuring both convenience and security. Here are these options:

- A Personal Identification Number (PIN) is a simple yet effective way to secure your phone. It’s a numeric code that you enter on the lock screen. Setting up a PIN is straightforward via the Motorola Edge 40 Pro device’s security settings, and unlocking your phone is as easy as tapping in the correct sequence of numbers.
- Similar to a PIN but potentially more secure due to the allowance of a longer combination of numbers and letters. A passcode is ideal for those who seek an extra layer of security. You set it up in the security settings and use it to unlock your phone just like a PIN but with the added complexity of alphanumeric characters.
- **Face Unlock.Pixel’s Face Unlock** uses advanced facial recognition software. It scans your face to grant access, offering a hands-free and quick way to unlock your Pixel. This feature can be activated in the security settings and requires a simple glance at your phone to unlock.

![woman holding a Motorola Edge 40 Pro](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/google-pixel-7-unlock-02.jpg)

- [**<u><b>Fingerprint Unlock</b></u>**](https://drfone.wondershare.com/google-frp-unlock/google-pixel-frp-bypass.html)**.** This method uses your unique fingerprint as a key. It’s fast, secure, and convenient. The Pixel 6a, 6, and 7 fingerprint scanners are actually under the display. Register your fingerprint in the settings, then touch the sensor to gain access.
- **Pattern**. If you prefer a more visual method, the [<u>pattern lock</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/mi-pattern-lock.html) lets you draw a specific shape or pattern on the screen to unlock your phone. It’s a fun and interactive way to secure your device. Create your pattern in the security settings, and unlock your phone by replicating it on the lock screen.

In essence, each unlocking method offered by the Motorola Edge 40 Pro  provides a blend of security and ease. Whichever unlocking method you prefer, Google ensures that accessing your phone is secure and convenient. All you need to do is set up your preferred method in the Motorola Edge 40 Pro device’s settings and use it to unlock your phone.

### Method 2: Entering Into Safe Mode

Safe Mode is a diagnostic mode in Android that can help bypass third-party lock screen apps. It’s useful if you’ve used a third-party app for your lock screen.

To do this, press the power button, then long-press on the **Power off** option. Tap **OK** when **Reboot to safe mode** option appears. In Safe Mode, third-party apps are disabled. Thus, you can now access your device if a third-party app is causing lock issues.

### Method 3: Force Resetting a Device/Flashing a New ROM

Force resetting or flashing a new ROM can be considered a last resort. They involve erasing all data on your device or installing a new operating system.

- **Force resetting your device**. To force reset your Motorola, press and hold the Power and Volume Down buttons simultaneously to enter recovery mode. Use the volume buttons to navigate to **Wipe data/factory reset**and select it with the power button. This will get rid of existing password locks.
- **Flashing a new ROM**. This is more complex and typically requires downloading a new firmware and flashing tool. It’s only recommended for advanced users or as a last resort.

Remember, while these methods can effectively unlock your device, they also come with risks. Always [<u>back up your data regularly</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/backup/android-backup-software.html), and use these methods responsibly, considering their potential to erase your data or affect your device’s warranty.

### Alternative Method: Android SIM Unlock

If your carrier cannot unlock your Motorola Edge 40 Pro  ’s SIM, or if you prefer a quicker solution, consider using network unlocking services. This may be websites like UnlockBase, Mobile Unlocks, etc.

- 4\. To set up a pattern lock screen, tap on the “Screen lock type” feature.
- 5\. This will provide a list of all the different kinds of locks that you can apply. Ideally, it would be password, pin, pattern, swipe, or none. In “Swipe”, you can unlock a device just by swiping the screen. Whereas, in pattern, pin, or password, you would be needed to provide the respective pattern/pin/password to unlock the Motorola Edge 40 Pro device.
- 6\. We recommend setting up a lock screen pattern instead. To do this, tap on the “Pattern” option.

- 7\. From the next screen, you can simply draw any kind of pattern of your choice. Ideally, it should join at least 4 dots on the screen. We recommend using a strong screen lock pattern to provide unmatched security to your device.
- 8\. Furthermore, you need to confirm your choice and provide the same pattern once again. Make sure that you draw the same pattern here.
- 9\. Additionally, the interface will ask you to provide a security pin as well. In case if you will forget your pattern, then you can access your phone by taking the assistance of this pin.

- 11\. That’s it! By completing these steps, a screen lock pattern will be implemented on your device.

Later, you can follow the same drill to change your device’s lock screen pattern as well. Though, you would be needed to provide the existing pattern to access these features. Out of all the lock screen options, you should go with the pattern lock. Not only it is the most accessible option, it also provides fast results with an added security.

## Part 2: What to do if you forget Android pattern lock?

After following the above-mentioned tutorial, you would be able to set up a pattern lock screen on your device. Since it is recommended to have a strong pattern lock, users often forget their pattern lock after implementing it. This prohibits them from using their own Android device. If you have a similar experience, then don’t worry. There are plenty of ways to unlock a device and remove its pattern lock without causing any harm to the system. Visit our informative tutorial and learn different ways to [unlock or bypass the Android pattern lock screen.](https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/pattern-lock.html)
