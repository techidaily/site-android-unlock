The issue limits the smartphone's functioning to the specific carrier from whom the Oppo Reno 11 5G device is purchased.

## Part 1: What Does It Mean When Your Oppo Reno 11 5G Phone is Network Locked?

In the simplest words, a network-locked Oppo Reno 11 5G phone means that your device has become carrier-specific. It will now work only with the network provider from where the phone was purchased. Another problem is that there is no automatic unlocking even after the expiry of your contract with the carrier service. Having a network-locked Oppo Reno 11 5G phone poses undesired connectivity issues.

### 1\. Why is my phone locked to the network carrier?

Smartphones are network locked by carrier services to prevent customers from switching to a different carrier.

### 2\. Is it legal to unlock it?

Unlocking your network-locked phone is legal in every sense. It is however advisable to contact your service provider for addressing the concern. The only downside of unlocking such phones is the loss of device warranty assured at the time of purchase.
