## How to Unlock a Network Locked Vivo X100 Phone?

Revolutions in the telecommunication industry have introduced advancements in smartphone features and utilities. The other side of the coin is, however, not as appealing. Thanks to the different carrier services, network locking is the commonest issue of recent mobile launches. Users have reported of Vivo X100 phones refusing to work with different carriers.

The issue limits the smartphone's functioning to the specific carrier from whom the Vivo X100 device is purchased. Consequently, there are annoying connectivity problems that restrict seamless mobile usage. The problem aggravates in geo-restricted regions where the carrier options are quite limited. This scenario puts forward the need for **Vivo X100 network unlock** solutions.

## Part 1: What Does It Mean When Your Vivo X100 Phone is Network Locked?

In the simplest words, a network-locked Vivo X100 phone means that your device has become carrier-specific. It will now work only with the network provider from where the phone was purchased. Another problem is that there is no automatic unlocking even after the expiry of your contract with the carrier service. Having a network-locked Vivo X100 phone poses undesired connectivity issues.

### 1\. Why is my phone locked to the network carrier?

Smartphones are network locked by carrier services to prevent customers from switching to a different carrier. Reasons for switching can be the availability of better plans, discounts, etc. Another cause of locking the phones to specific carriers is preventing them from theft and unauthorized usage.

### 2\. Is it legal to unlock it?

Unlocking your network-locked phone is legal in every sense. It is however advisable to contact your service provider for addressing the concern. The only downside of unlocking such phones is the loss of device warranty assured at the time of purchase.

## Useful Methods to Bypass Fingerprint Lock

If your fingerprint is not working or the Vivo X100 device prompts you with an error in the fingerprint functioning, possibly the fingerprint reader is not responding, and the Vivo X100 device needs to restart to get rid of this error.

![phone restart ui](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/how-to-bypass-android-fingerprint-lock-3.jpg)

When a device restarts, the fingerprint functionality is restored after entering the Vivo X100 device pattern, password, or PIN. This is the simplest method to reset your fingerprint hardware.

### 2\. Remove your phone battery

Old android phones have removable batteries. If you can remove your phone battery, remove it and then put it back. Now turn on your phone. Doing so can help solve the fingerprint lock issue if there are bugs or system errors.
