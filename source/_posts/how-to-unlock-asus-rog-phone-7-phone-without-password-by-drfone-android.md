### Using Google Account Details

Almost all Android smartphones, including Asus ROG Phone 7 , require you to enter your Google account details when setting up your phone for the first time. This account comes in handy later on in situations where your phone is lost or stolen or if you’re switching to another phone. However, it can also help with basic issues like unlocking your phone in case you forget your Asus ROG Phone 7  screen unlock PIN, pattern, or password. But to use this method successfully, you need to remember the email address bound to the Asus ROG Phone 7 device and its password.

Here's how to unlock the Asus ROG Phone 7  pattern lock without losing data using your Google account:

- **Step 1:** Enter the incorrect PIN, pattern, or password 5 times, and click on “Forgot Password” or “Forgot Pattern.”

### Using Security Question

Another way to unlock your Asus ROG Phone 7  phone using Google is by answering the security question. When we set up our Google account, we usually choose a security question and an answer.

## How to Unlock Asus ROG Phone 7  by Hard Reset?

Hard resetting your smartphone usually solves everything! Hence, it can also help you unlock your Asus ROG Phone 7  phone; however, using this method will erase all the data on your phone. So, if you still want to unlock Asus ROG Phone 7  phone using this method, only do so if you have backed up your device and have no other way to unlock your phone.

## How to Remove Operator Lock on Asus ROG Phone 7 ?

An operator lock, also called a carrier lock, constitutes a limitation imposed on a mobile phone by a network provider. This measure is implemented to guarantee that the Asus ROG Phone 7 device exclusively functions with the services provided by that specific carrier. If you wish to remove the operator lock from your Asus ROG Phone 7  device, you'll need to follow specific steps and meet certain criteria. Here's how to remove the operator lock on a Asus ROG Phone 7 :

**Step 1:** Begin by checking whether your device can be unlocked or not from its network carrier restrictions. To do that, you need to dial the code “\*#\*#7378423#\*#\*” on your device, tap “Service Info” and select “SIM Lock.”

![dial the provided number](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/10/unlock-sony-xperia-pin-code-5.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
**Step 2:** Carefully check the information provided on the screen. If there is "X" before the "Network" option and the number in front of it is larger than 0, it means your device can be unlocked. If the number in front of "Network" is 0, your device can't be unlocked as it is hard-locked.

![check the network status](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/10/unlock-sony-xperia-pin-code-6.jpg)

**Step 3:** The next step involves getting your device’s IMEI number. To accomplish this task, simply input "\*#06#" on your device. Once you have the IMEI number, use a reliable service from the internet to the unlocking code. Insert the SIM card of another network and provide the code you gained to unlock your Asus ROG Phone 7  device.
