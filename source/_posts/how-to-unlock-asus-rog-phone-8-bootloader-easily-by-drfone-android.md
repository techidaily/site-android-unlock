## Part 1: Ways That Asus Lets You Unlock Your Asus ROG Phone 8

- **Face Unlock.Pixel’s Face Unlock** uses advanced facial recognition software. It scans your face to grant access, offering a hands-free and quick way to unlock your Pixel. This feature can be activated in the security settings and requires a simple glance at your phone to unlock.

## Method 1: Unlock Asus ROG Phone 8  Phones Running Older Android OS (4.4 Or Below) With Google Security Questions

Up until Android version 4.4, you could lock your phone screen with a pattern. Google allowed you to unlock the phone by answering security questions in case you forgot the pattern. Since these may also be easily guessed by people who are in possession of your device illegally, Google deprecated this method after Android 4.4. However, the phones running Android 4.4 or lower are still allowed to be unlocked using this method. So, if you have an old Asus ROG Phone 8  with Android 4.4 or earlier, here is **how to unlock Asus ROG Phone 8  phone password without factory reset**:

**Step 1:** You may already have entered the incorrect pattern a few times. If so, simply tap the Forgot Pattern to start the process of unlocking your Asus ROG Phone 8  phone screen. Else, deliberately enter incorrect pattern a few times till you see the Forgot Pattern option:

**Step 3:** Sign into the Google account that matches with the Google account on the phone.

**Step 4:** Lastly, create a new pattern to unlock your Asus ROG Phone 8  phone.

There is a standard factory reset built into every Asus ROG Phone 8  phone to allow users to erase the Asus ROG Phone 8 device and start over fully. This option wipes all user data and resets the phone to how you received it in the box.

**Step 2:** Tap Factory Reset > Reset Phone.

**Step 3:** Tap Erase Everything.

## Method 4: Use Google Find My Device To Unlock Asus ROG Phone 8  Phones (Wipes User Data)

Using Find My Device, you can play a sound on the Asus ROG Phone 8 device to locate it in the house if you have misplaced it, lock the phone in case it is lost, and wipe the Asus ROG Phone 8 device remotely.

**Step 1:** Go to <https://accounts.google.com>.

**Step 2:** Log in and go to Security > Your Devices:
