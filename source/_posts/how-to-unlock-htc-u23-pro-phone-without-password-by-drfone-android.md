**Step 6.** ADB terminal will pop out. Now, the first is to type in ADB _devices_. This is to check if your device is recognized by ADB. If there is no device listed below, try to remove and reconnect your HTC U23 Pro and retype the command. If there are listed devices already, proceed.

![Minimal adb and fastboot command window adb devices command](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/06/14648317691463.jpg)

**Step 7.** Finally, type in the following commands **one by one****.** These commands will remove your lock screen.

- _adb shell_
- _cd /data/data/com.android.providers.settings/databases_
- _sqlite3 settings.db_
- _update system set value=0 where_
- _name='lock\_pattern\_autolock';_
- _update system set value=0 where_
- _name='lockscreen.lockedoutpermanently';_
- _.quit_

![Minimal adb and fastboot adb shell command](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/06/14648317729484.jpg)

This would work if you have your USB debugging turned on before it was locked. That's how to unlock Android using ADB.
