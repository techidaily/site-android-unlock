PRECAUTION:  At best, this can be the first level of security, as one who resembles you to some extent can unlock the Huawei Nova Y91 device. Photographs are not stored in the system. The device does hold necessary data to recognize your face, and the security level is determined by how good the Huawei Nova Y91 device is configured. The data is not accessed by any app or loaded onto a Google server for backup.

_Setting Up Trusted Face_

- • Go to Smart Lock and tap Trusted Face.
- • Tap on Setup. Follow on-screen instructions.
