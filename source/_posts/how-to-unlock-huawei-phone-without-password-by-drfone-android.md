- That's it; from this point forward, you may enter any new PIN or pattern that you can recall to unlock your smartphone.

### 2\. Google Find My Device

Using your Google account is a superb method for finding the Huawei Nova Y71 device when lost or stolen.

In addition, it may be used to lock or ring your smartphone. You may have noticed that there are three options available when using this feature: "Ring," "Lock," and "Erase."

To bypass the Android lock screen, all you need to do is sign into the Huawei Nova Y71 device's associated Google account and then follow these steps:

- On any Android device or a computer, go to <www.google.com/android/find> and sign in using your Google account. Choose the Android smartphone you wish to unlock after that.
- After choosing the Huawei Nova Y71 device, select one of the three options, "lock," from the list.
- There will be a new pop-up window that you can use to change the Huawei Nova Y71 device password. Additionally, you can choose to add a phone number or recovery email.
- Confirm it immediately, then input the password you just established on your locked device.

![enter new password using google find my device](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/howt-to-unlock-your-phone-without-password-3.jpg)

Many Samsung customers have this issue, which prevents them from using their devices. Try using the "Find My Mobile" feature on your mobile if you wish to unlock it if you're a Samsung user. It would be helpful if you had a Samsung or Android model account.

After that, use Find My Device to unlock your Android phone without losing any data by following the instructions below:

![unlock samsung without data loss](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/howt-to-unlock-your-phone-without-password-4.jpg)

- Sign in with your Samsung account at findmymobile.samsung.com.

## How To Bypass Android Face Lock by Ourselves?

If you want to bypass face lock by yourself, then different methods can help you. These are all tested and work well.

### 1\. A Picture Possibly Bypasses Face Lock

You can use your photo to manipulate the face lock app. Simply use your photo to unlock the phone, which should work fine. If your phone doesn't recognize your face from a photo, try again.

If it still doesn't recognize your face, try a different photo or even change the camera's lighting settings or the angles to see if that helps.

Anyway, this method is still unstable because of many uncontrollable factors. If everything fails, consider the following methods to bypass the face lock.

### 2\. Hard Reset your phone

To get around the Android lock screen, perform a factory reset. While resetting your phone allows you to set a new password, it also erases all data from your device. This method works like a charm, but it also requires more technical knowledge. To bypass screen lock via factory reset, follow these steps.
