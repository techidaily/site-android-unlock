## Part 1: Lock System About Lava Agni 2 5G  

### 1: Lock Types

Before we move towards the **Lava Agni 2 5G  pattern unlock**, let's talk about its lock types and security system. Lava Agni 2 5G  is one of the older versions of Lava  android phones that was released in 2016. At that time, only flagship phones from each brand came with features like fingerprint sensors and facial unlock. Lava Agni 2 5G  doesn't offer these lock types. You can only set up a screen lock as a password, pattern, and PIN. You can also lock apps on Lava Agni 2 5G  with its privacy password settings.

### 2: How to Set Them up?

Follow these steps to set up any type of lock on your Lava Agni 2 5G  .

- Open “Settings” on your mobile and select "Lockscreen and Password".
- The lock system menu would appear if your device had no screen locks. If your device has a screen lock, you will have to enter the password to enter the settings.
- Select the "Lockscreen Password" option at the top and tap on the "Enable Lock Screen" button.
- Select the type of lock you want to set and create a password.

### 3: How to Remove Them with Password or Pattern?

You can easily remove the lock screen of your Lava Agni 2 5G  if you remember your password or pattern.

## Part 2: 5 Solutions to Unlock Lava Agni 2 5G  Without Password or Pattern

### 1: Google Find My Device

Most people use it to factory reset their phones when someone steals their phones. Although Google Find My Device works every time, it is not the ideal solution if you don't want to lose your data.

### 4: Hard Reset (data loss)

A hard reset would be the best solution if you forgot your phone's lock screen password or pattern. However, you can unlock your phone with your Google account as well. Do a hard reset if you can't remember your Google account password and don't want to use third-party tools. The only problem with hard resetting is that you lose all your data, images, files, settings, and personalization. That is why you can't recover any of your data after the hard reset if you don't have a data backup. The process of hard reset is different for every device. Here are the steps for **Lava Agni 2 5G  pattern unlock without a PC** through a hard reset.

- Switch off your Lava Agni 2 5G  with the power button.

![power key](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/oppo-a37-password-unlock-04.jpg)
