## How to Unlock Motorola Defy 2  with Google Account?

Almost all Android smartphones, including Motorola Defy 2 , require you to enter your Google account details when setting up your phone for the first time. This includes the email, password, and security question. These details come in handy later on in situations where your phone is lost or stolen or if you’re switching to another phone. However, they can also help with basic issues like unlocking your phone in case you forget your Motorola Defy 2  screen unlock PIN, pattern, or password.

Almost all Android smartphones, including Motorola Defy 2 , require you to enter your Google account details when setting up your phone for the first time.

## How to Remove Operator Lock on Motorola Defy 2 ?

An operator lock, also called a carrier lock, constitutes a limitation imposed on a mobile phone by a network provider. This measure is implemented to guarantee that the Motorola Defy 2 device exclusively functions with the services provided by that specific carrier. If you wish to remove the operator lock from your Motorola Defy 2  device, you'll need to follow specific steps and meet certain criteria. Here's how to remove the operator lock on a Motorola Defy 2 :

**Step 1:** Begin by checking whether your device can be unlocked or not from its network carrier restrictions. To do that, you need to dial the code “\*#\*#7378423#\*#\*” on your device, tap “Service Info” and select “SIM Lock.”

**Step 2:** Carefully check the information provided on the screen. If there is "X" before the "Network" option and the number in front of it is larger than 0, it means your device can be unlocked. If the number in front of "Network" is 0, your device can't be unlocked as it is hard-locked.
