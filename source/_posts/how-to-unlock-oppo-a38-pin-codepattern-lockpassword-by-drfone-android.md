## How to Unlock Oppo A38  with Google Account?

Almost all Android smartphones, including Oppo A38 , require you to enter your Google account details when setting up your phone for the first time. This includes the email, password, and security question. These details come in handy later on in situations where your phone is lost or stolen or if you’re switching to another phone. However, they can also help with basic issues like unlocking your phone in case you forget your Oppo A38  screen unlock PIN, pattern, or password.

You can unlock your Oppo A38  phone with Google Account in the following two ways:

- Using Google account details
- Using Google security question

### Using Google Account Details

Almost all Android smartphones, including Oppo A38 , require you to enter your Google account details when setting up your phone for the first time.

However, it can also help with basic issues like unlocking your phone in case you forget your Oppo A38  screen unlock PIN, pattern, or password. But to use this method successfully, you need to remember the email address bound to the Oppo A38 device and its password.

If you don't remember your Google account details, you can still unlock your Oppo A38  phone using a third-party tool.

### Using Security Question

Another way to unlock your Oppo A38  phone using Google is by answering the security question. When we set up our Google account, we usually choose a security question and an answer. This comes in handy if you want to recover your Google account, reset the password, or if you want to unlock your phone's screen.

For the latter, here are the steps:

- **Step 1:** Enter the incorrect PIN or pattern to unlock your screen several times till you see the “Forgot Pattern” or “Forgot Password” option. Click on it.
- **Step 2:** Now select the “Answer Security Question” option and type in the answer.

If you wish to remove the operator lock from your Oppo A38  device, you'll need to follow specific steps and meet certain criteria. Here's how to remove the operator lock on a Oppo A38 :
