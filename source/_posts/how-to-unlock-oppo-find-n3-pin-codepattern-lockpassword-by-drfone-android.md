Almost all Android smartphones, including Oppo Find N3 , require you to enter your Google account details when setting up your phone for the first time.

### Using Google Account Details

Almost all Android smartphones, including Oppo Find N3 , require you to enter your Google account details when setting up your phone for the first time. This account comes in handy later on in situations where your phone is lost or stolen or if you’re switching to another phone. However, it can also help with basic issues like unlocking your phone in case you forget your Oppo Find N3  screen unlock PIN, pattern, or password. But to use this method successfully, you need to remember the email address bound to the Oppo Find N3 device and its password.

Here's how to unlock the Oppo Find N3  pattern lock without losing data using your Google account:

- **Step 1:** Enter the incorrect PIN, pattern, or password 5 times, and click on “Forgot Password” or “Forgot Pattern.”

### Using Security Question

Another way to unlock your Oppo Find N3  phone using Google is by answering the security question. When we set up our Google account, we usually choose a security question and an answer.

- **Step 1:** Enter the incorrect PIN or pattern to unlock your screen several times till you see the “Forgot Pattern” or “Forgot Password” option. Click on it.
- **Step 2:** Now select the “Answer Security Question” option and type in the answer.

## How to Unlock Oppo Find N3  by Hard Reset?

Hard resetting your smartphone usually solves everything! Hence, it can also help you unlock your Oppo Find N3  phone; however, using this method will erase all the data on your phone. So, if you still want to unlock Oppo Find N3  phone using this method, only do so if you have backed up your device and have no other way to unlock your phone. This includes forgetting your Google account details or not having access to a PC to download and use Dr Fone - Screen Unlock (Android).

## How to Remove Operator Lock on Oppo Find N3 ?

An operator lock, also called a carrier lock, constitutes a limitation imposed on a mobile phone by a network provider.
