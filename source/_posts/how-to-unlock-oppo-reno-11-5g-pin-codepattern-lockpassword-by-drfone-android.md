So, if you still want to unlock Oppo Reno 11 5G  phone using this method, only do so if you have backed up your device and have no other way to unlock your phone. This includes forgetting your Google account details or not having access to a PC to download and use Dr Fone - Screen Unlock (Android).

- **Step 1:** Power off your Oppo Reno 11 5G  phone.

## How to Remove Operator Lock on Oppo Reno 11 5G ?

An operator lock, also called a carrier lock, constitutes a limitation imposed on a mobile phone by a network provider. This measure is implemented to guarantee that the Oppo Reno 11 5G device exclusively functions with the services provided by that specific carrier. If you wish to remove the operator lock from your Oppo Reno 11 5G  device, you'll need to follow specific steps and meet certain criteria. Here's how to remove the operator lock on a Oppo Reno 11 5G :
