## Method 2: Using a USB Mouse and the On the Go Adapter

This is a great solution if you don’t have USB debugging enabled on your device. You will need your device, an OTG adapter and a USB mouse. It involves connecting the Oppo Reno 11 Pro 5G device to the USB mouse using the OTG adapter. Check if your device can be connected to a USB mouse. You can find an OTG adapter online, they are relatively inexpensive and very useful.

Before we begin, it is a good idea to ensure your device is sufficiently charged because the Mouse may drain your battery.

**Step 1:** Connect the Micro USB side of the OTG adapter to your device and then plug in the USB mouse to the adapter.

**Step 2:** As soon as the Oppo Reno 11 Pro 5G devices are connected, you will be able to see a pointer on your screen. You can then use the pointer to unlock the pattern or enter the Oppo Reno 11 Pro 5G device’s password lock.

You can then go about backing up the contents of your device.

## Method 3: Using your Samsung Account

This method is a reliable way to unlock a Samsung device that has a broken screen or is not working correctly. While it is highly effective you will need to have a Samsung account registered with your device. The problem is that not many Samsung device users have registered their devices with the service. If you are among the lucky few who have, here’s how to use your account to unlock your device.

**Step 1:** Visit the [https://findmymobile.samsung.com/login.do](https://findmymobile.samsung.com/login.do) on your PC or any other device and log in with your account information.

**Step 3:** You should see the option “Unlock my screen” on the sidebar. Click on it and you will get instructions on how to access your device.

This way your life doesn’t have to be disrupted- you can just restore the backup on a new device or the old one once the screen is fixed.
