## Part 1: What Does It Mean When Your Samsung Galaxy A23 5G Phone is Network Locked?

In the simplest words, a network-locked Samsung Galaxy A23 5G phone means that your device has become carrier-specific.

Having a network-locked Samsung Galaxy A23 5G phone poses undesired connectivity issues.

### 1\. Why is my phone locked to the network carrier?

Smartphones are network locked by carrier services to prevent customers from switching to a different carrier. Reasons for switching can be the availability of better plans, discounts, etc. Another cause of locking the phones to specific carriers is preventing them from theft and unauthorized usage.
