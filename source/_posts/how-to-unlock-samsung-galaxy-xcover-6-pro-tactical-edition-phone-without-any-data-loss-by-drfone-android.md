Thanks to the different carrier services, network locking is the commonest issue of recent mobile launches. Users have reported of Samsung Galaxy XCover 6 Pro Tactical Edition phones refusing to work with different carriers.

The issue limits the smartphone's functioning to the specific carrier from whom the Samsung Galaxy XCover 6 Pro Tactical Edition device is purchased.

This scenario puts forward the need for **Samsung Galaxy XCover 6 Pro Tactical Edition network unlock** solutions.

## Part 1: What Does It Mean When Your Samsung Galaxy XCover 6 Pro Tactical Edition Phone is Network Locked?

In the simplest words, a network-locked Samsung Galaxy XCover 6 Pro Tactical Edition phone means that your device has become carrier-specific.

### 2\. Is it legal to unlock it?

Unlocking your network-locked phone is legal in every sense. It is however advisable to contact your service provider for addressing the concern. The only downside of unlocking such phones is the loss of device warranty assured at the time of purchase.
