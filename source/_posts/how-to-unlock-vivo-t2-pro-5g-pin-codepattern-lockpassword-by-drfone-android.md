## How to Unlock Vivo T2 Pro 5G  with Google Account?

## How to Remove Operator Lock on Vivo T2 Pro 5G ?

An operator lock, also called a carrier lock, constitutes a limitation imposed on a mobile phone by a network provider. This measure is implemented to guarantee that the Vivo T2 Pro 5G device exclusively functions with the services provided by that specific carrier. If you wish to remove the operator lock from your Vivo T2 Pro 5G  device, you'll need to follow specific steps and meet certain criteria. Here's how to remove the operator lock on a Vivo T2 Pro 5G :

**Step 1:** Begin by checking whether your device can be unlocked or not from its network carrier restrictions. To do that, you need to dial the code “\*#\*#7378423#\*#\*” on your device, tap “Service Info” and select “SIM Lock.”

![dial the provided number](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/10/unlock-sony-xperia-pin-code-5.jpg)

**Step 2:** Carefully check the information provided on the screen. If there is "X" before the "Network" option and the number in front of it is larger than 0, it means your device can be unlocked. If the number in front of "Network" is 0, your device can't be unlocked as it is hard-locked.

![check the network status](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/10/unlock-sony-xperia-pin-code-6.jpg)

**Step 3:** The next step involves getting your device’s IMEI number. To accomplish this task, simply input "\*#06#" on your device.

## Can I Bypass a Forgotten Phone Password Of Vivo T2 Pro 5G?

Screen locks on smartphones are crucial for keeping the data in your phone hidden. **Password for phone** becomes necessary when you have critical data on your phone. However, there is a downside to it.

Many people forget their screen lock, and that's normal. That can happen if you accidentally type a new **lock screen password** incorrectly. Apart from that, there are many other explanations too. In short, you can get locked out of your device, which is a terrible experience. It can waste your time if you need something stored in your phone.

Here we have mentioned solutions to let you bypass your **lock screen password.** All the solutions mentioned here are safe and will work almost 100% of the time.

## Part 1: How Can I Set or Change My password?

- Open the Settings application and tap the Security choice.
- Under Device Security, tap Screen Lock.

![screen lock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/what-is-my-phone-password-1.jpg)

- Select a Screen lock option, i.e., Swipe, Example, PIN, Password, etc.

![screen lock options](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/what-is-my-phone-password-2.jpg)

- Then redo your screen lock on the following screen, then, at that point, tap Confirm.

## Part 2: 4 Simple Ways to Bypass Your Vivo T2 Pro 5G Phone Password

### 1\. Google Find My Device

Our first approach to unlocking your device is to do a factory reset. That erases every one of the data on your phone too. You can perform this method if you have your Google account credentials and are ready. However, we want you to back up your data so you can sign once more after the reset and restore a ton of your data.

Since you're locked out, you will have to utilize a technique to do the reset. The most straightforward way is to utilize Google's Find My Device site. So, if the Find my Device option feature is enabled on your phone, you can tap the **Erase device** choice on this page to reset it.

![google find my device](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/what-is-my-phone-password-3.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 2\. Enter Recovery Mode to Hard Reset

If you can't use the Find my device feature, you'll have to factory reset physically. To do as such:

- Power your device off.
- Hold the Volume (-) and power keys all the while after the screen goes dark to raise Android's bootloader menu. This button blend might be different relying on your device model.
- Press the Volume down button two times to feature the Recovery Mode choice. Then, at that point, press the power button to choose it.
- Hold the power button and press the Volume up button to enter this mode.
- Utilize the volume buttons to go to the Wipe data/Factory Reset choice. Continue with the steps to play out a factory reset.

### 3\. Use ADB

This fix isn't guaranteed to work; if you don't watch out, it could damage your phone. Therefore, we suggest you back up everything on your Android before proceeding.

If your phone has USB debugging enabled, is connected to a PC, and is not encrypted, follow these steps:

- Connect your device to your PC through a USB connector.
- Open Command Prompt or Terminal window to your ADB installation registry.
- Type in adb shell rm/data/system/gesture.key and click the Enter key.
- Reboot your phone. When you do, the solid lock screen ought to be gone.
- That is not a permanent condition, so reset your PIN or password lock before you reboot your device once more. That's how you reset **password for phone.**

### 4.Dr.Fone-Screen Unlock

If you want to unlock your phone without losing any data, we suggest Dr.Fone-Screen Unlock. Dr.Fone is a professional unlocking tool that can remove all types of screen locks in minutes.
