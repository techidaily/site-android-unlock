## How to Unlock Vivo X90S  with Google Account?

Almost all Android smartphones, including Vivo X90S , require you to enter your Google account details when setting up your phone for the first time. This includes the email, password, and security question. These details come in handy later on in situations where your phone is lost or stolen or if you’re switching to another phone. However, they can also help with basic issues like unlocking your phone in case you forget your Vivo X90S  screen unlock PIN, pattern, or password.

You can unlock your Vivo X90S  phone with Google Account in the following two ways:

- Using Google account details
- Using Google security question

### Using Google Account Details

Almost all Android smartphones, including Vivo X90S , require you to enter your Google account details when setting up your phone for the first time. This account comes in handy later on in situations where your phone is lost or stolen or if you’re switching to another phone. However, it can also help with basic issues like unlocking your phone in case you forget your Vivo X90S  screen unlock PIN, pattern, or password. But to use this method successfully, you need to remember the email address bound to the Vivo X90S device and its password.

If you don't remember your Google account details, you can still unlock your Vivo X90S  phone using a third-party tool.

### Using Security Question

## How to Remove Operator Lock on Vivo X90S ?

An operator lock, also called a carrier lock, constitutes a limitation imposed on a mobile phone by a network provider. This measure is implemented to guarantee that the Vivo X90S device exclusively functions with the services provided by that specific carrier. If you wish to remove the operator lock from your Vivo X90S  device, you'll need to follow specific steps and meet certain criteria. Here's how to remove the operator lock on a Vivo X90S :

**Step 1:** Begin by checking whether your device can be unlocked or not from its network carrier restrictions. To do that, you need to dial the code “\*#\*#7378423#\*#\*” on your device, tap “Service Info” and select “SIM Lock.”

![dial the provided number](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/10/unlock-sony-xperia-pin-code-5.jpg)

**Step 2:** Carefully check the information provided on the screen. If there is "X" before the "Network" option and the number in front of it is larger than 0, it means your device can be unlocked. If the number in front of "Network" is 0, your device can't be unlocked as it is hard-locked.

![check the network status](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/10/unlock-sony-xperia-pin-code-6.jpg)

**Step 3:** The next step involves getting your device’s IMEI number. To accomplish this task, simply input "\*#06#" on your device. Once you have the IMEI number, use a reliable service from the internet to the unlocking code. Insert the SIM card of another network and provide the code you gained to unlock your Vivo X90S  device.

**Step 4.** Make sure your device is connected, then go to the Minimal ADB and Fastboot installation directory.

This PC \[Win 8& 10\] or My computer \[Windows 7 & below\]> Local Disk (C:) \[primary drive\]> Program Files \[for 32-bit\] or Program Files (x86) \[for 64-bit\] > Minimal ADB and Fasboot.

**Step 5.** Inside the folder, hold the Shift key on your keyboard, then right-click your mouse. An additional "Open command window here" will appear so select that.

![Minimal adb and fastboot open command](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/06/14648313653169.jpg)

**Step 6.** ADB terminal will pop out. Now, the first is to type in ADB _devices_. This is to check if your device is recognized by ADB. If there is no device listed below, try to remove and reconnect your Vivo X90S and retype the command. If there are listed devices already, proceed.

![Minimal adb and fastboot command window adb devices command](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/06/14648317691463.jpg)

**Step 7.** Finally, type in the following commands **one by one****.** These commands will remove your lock screen.

- _adb shell_
- _cd /data/data/com.android.providers.settings/databases_
- _sqlite3 settings.db_
- _update system set value=0 where_
- _name='lock\_pattern\_autolock';_
- _update system set value=0 where_
- _name='lockscreen.lockedoutpermanently';_
- _.quit_

![Minimal adb and fastboot adb shell command](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/06/14648317729484.jpg)

This would work if you have your USB debugging turned on before it was locked. That's how to unlock Android using ADB.
