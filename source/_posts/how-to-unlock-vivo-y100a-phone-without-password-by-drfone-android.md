## Part 1: Unlock Your Locked Screen Without Password By 6 Efficient Ways

### 1\. By your Google account

You can use your Google Account to unlock the Android phone password if, after several tries, you are still unable to do so without doing a factory reset.

You need to log into the Google account that is associated with the Vivo Y100A device, then do the following:

- The unlock pattern may only be used five times before a notification telling you to try again in 30 seconds appears.
- "Forgot pattern" will show up at the bottom of the screen.

![unlock with security question](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/howt-to-unlock-your-phone-without-password-1.jpg)

- You must enter the Gmail account that is associated with the Vivo Y100A device here before selecting "Next."

![answer the security question](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/howt-to-unlock-your-phone-without-password-2.jpg)

- That's it; from this point forward, you may enter any new PIN or pattern that you can recall to unlock your smartphone.

### 2\. Google Find My Device

Using your Google account is a superb method for finding the Vivo Y100A device when lost or stolen.

In addition, it may be used to lock or ring your smartphone. You may have noticed that there are three options available when using this feature: "Ring," "Lock," and "Erase."

To bypass the Android lock screen, all you need to do is sign into the Vivo Y100A device's associated Google account and then follow these steps:

- On any Android device or a computer, go to <www.google.com/android/find> and sign in using your Google account. Choose the Android smartphone you wish to unlock after that.
- After choosing the Vivo Y100A device, select one of the three options, "lock," from the list.
- There will be a new pop-up window that you can use to change the Vivo Y100A device password. Additionally, you can choose to add a phone number or recovery email.
- Confirm it immediately, then input the password you just established on your locked device.

![enter new password using google find my device](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/howt-to-unlock-your-phone-without-password-3.jpg)

Many Samsung customers have this issue, which prevents them from using their devices. Try using the "Find My Mobile" feature on your mobile if you wish to unlock it if you're a Samsung user. It would be helpful if you had a Samsung or Android model account.

After that, use Find My Device to unlock your Android phone without losing any data by following the instructions below:

![unlock samsung without data loss](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/howt-to-unlock-your-phone-without-password-4.jpg)

Your smartphone will be unlocked, and the password will be changed to the new one after a brief delay.

### 3\. Use ADB (Android Debug Bridge)

Without a factory reset, Android phone passwords may also be unlocked using the Android Debug Bridge (ADB).

- You must first download ADB to your computer. Visit the Android developer's website at <https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb.html> to do this.
- Launch the installer after that to begin downloading crucial software for your machine.

![launch the adb installer to unlock android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/howt-to-unlock-your-phone-without-password-6.jpg)

- Here, you must use a USB cable to connect your Vivo Y100A to the computer
- This will activate the developer option on your smartphone if you navigate to Settings > About Phone > and choose the "Build Number" option seven times.
- After that, activate USB debugging by going to Settings > Developer Options.

![activate USB debugging from settings](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/howt-to-unlock-your-phone-without-password-7.jpg)

![go to system and enter command line](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/howt-to-unlock-your-phone-without-password-8.jpg)

- Finally, just restart your smartphone and use it as normal.

### 4\. Hard reset (data loss)

Each brand has a unique method for hard resetting a locked Android device. The methods to factory reset locked Android devices from Samsung, LG, HTC, Sony, and Huawei are compiled here.

When your phone is locked, you may access the recovery menu of your phone using its physical keys and choose to hard reset the Vivo Y100A device. Here's how to restore a locked phone to factory settings.

- Use the buttons to see the recovery menu.
- Press and hold the Volume Up and Side buttons simultaneously until you see the brand logo on the screen for Android devices without a Power/Bixby/Home button.
- Press and hold the Volume Up, Bixby, and Power buttons all at once if your smartphone has a Power button. Releasing them before a logo arises is advised.
- Use the Volume Down key to highlight Wipe data/factory reset when the Android system recovery option displays, then hit the Power/Bixby key to choose it.
- Allow a few seconds for the factory reset procedure to finish after selecting Yes, or Factory data reset. The phone will reboot once you pick the Reboot system. Now you may configure it as if it were a brand-new gadget.

![reboot the system and follow factory reset](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/howt-to-unlock-your-phone-without-password-9.jpg)

### 5\. Unlock from Forgot Pattern (android 4.4 or lower)

This is another choice that might assist you in unlocking your phone without a factory reset or password. You may have observed that when pattern lock was enabled on your device, a security PIN question was also prompted at that time.

Therefore, you have the choice to Backup PIN, which might assist you in unlocking your smartphone, if you are unable to unlock it. To do it, take the following actions:
