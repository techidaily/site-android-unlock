## 1\. How to Unlock Vivo Y100i  With Google Find My Vivo Y100i?

A way to unlock the Vivo Y100i  phone is via Google Find My Device feature. While this method can help unlock your phone, it erases all content from it.

**Step 1:** Open your browser and go to [Google Find My Device](https://www.google.com/android/find) on your PC.

 And then select “**Erase Device.**”

Use this method only if your phone is backed up so you can restore all your data later.

### Using Google Account Details

Almost all Android smartphones, including Vivo Y100i , require you to enter your Google account details when setting up your phone for the first time. This account comes in handy later on in situations where your phone is lost or stolen or if you’re switching to another phone. However, it can also help with basic issues like unlocking your phone in case you forget your Vivo Y100i  screen unlock PIN, pattern, or password. But to use this method successfully, you need to remember the email address bound to the Vivo Y100i device and its password.

Here's how to unlock the Vivo Y100i  pattern lock without losing data using your Google account:

- **Step 1:** Enter the incorrect PIN, pattern, or password 5 times, and click on “Forgot Password” or “Forgot Pattern.”
- **Step 2:** The interface will then ask you to enter your Google account details as an alternate option. Enter the Google account details you used when setting up your Vivo Y100i  phone.
- **Step 3:** This will unlock your phone. You can now reset the screen unlock PIN, password, or pattern.

If you don't remember your Google account details, you can still unlock your Vivo Y100i  phone using a third-party tool.

## How to Unlock Vivo Y100i  by Hard Reset?

Hard resetting your smartphone usually solves everything! Hence, it can also help you unlock your Vivo Y100i  phone; however, using this method will erase all the data on your phone.

## How to Remove Operator Lock on Vivo Y100i ?

An operator lock, also called a carrier lock, constitutes a limitation imposed on a mobile phone by a network provider. This measure is implemented to guarantee that the Vivo Y100i device exclusively functions with the services provided by that specific carrier. If you wish to remove the operator lock from your Vivo Y100i  device, you'll need to follow specific steps and meet certain criteria. Here's how to remove the operator lock on a Vivo Y100i :

**Step 1:** Begin by checking whether your device can be unlocked or not from its network carrier restrictions. To do that, you need to dial the code “\*#\*#7378423#\*#\*” on your device, tap “Service Info” and select “SIM Lock.”

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
**Step 2:** Carefully check the information provided on the screen. If there is "X" before the "Network" option and the number in front of it is larger than 0, it means your device can be unlocked. If the number in front of "Network" is 0, your device can't be unlocked as it is hard-locked.
