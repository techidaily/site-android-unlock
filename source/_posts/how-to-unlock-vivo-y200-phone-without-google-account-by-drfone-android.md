### 4\. Preference for Third-Party Tools

Certain users might have a preference for specialized third-party password management tools. They can go for solutions that offer a wider array of features. Many users might want to find options better aligned with their specific needs. This prompts them to disable Google Smart Lock.

The result is that you have locked out of your phone, and you have to reset your device's password. But fortunately, there's an easy way to unlock your Vivo screen without entering any passwords. You can have your phone up and running in a few simple steps without contacting customer service.

So don't wait any longer - read on for instructions on how to unlock the Vivo phone pin code.

Like most people, you probably lock your Vivo phone as soon as you turn it on. It's a good way to keep your phone safe from prying eyes and accidental button presses. But what happens when you forget your phone's passcode? Or worse, what if your phone gets locked by a malicious app?

There are a few different ways to unlock your Vivo phone. We'll show you how to do it.

## Method 1. Google Find My Device (Without Password/Pin/Pattern)

If you're like me, you've probably tried a million different ways to unlock your Vivo phone, only to be frustrated by the results. Luckily, there's an easy way to unlock your Vivo phone using Google's Find My Device feature.

Google will use your location, phone information, and connection log to find your Nokia.

- **Step 2**: Sign in with your Google account, which you used on your locked Vivo phone.
- **Step 3**: The Android Device Manager dashboard will show your locked Vivo with three options: Ring, Lock, and Erase.
- **Step 4**: Simply click on "Lock".
- **Step 5**: Enter a password that is not your Google account password in the "New Password" field.
- **Step 6**: Type the new password in the "Confirm password" field. This password lock will replace the current lock screen.
- **Step 7**: You can leave the "Recovery message" field empty or type anything in it.
- **Step 8**: Enter another phone number in the "Phone number" field, although this is optional.
- **Step 9**: Choose "Lock" after entering your password and filling out the optional fields if you wish.
- **Step 10**: If the process is successful, you will receive the unlock code within a few seconds.
- **Step 11**: Navigate to the "Screen Settings" menu after unlocking your device.
- **Step 12**: Use a new password; you can use the temporary password if you want.

You can use it to unlock your Vivo if you have activated the Android Device Manager or Google Find My Device before your phone was locked.
