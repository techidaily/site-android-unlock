Nothing could be more frustrating than gazing at your phone, knowing that it is essentially a paperweight at this point. Unless you can get it unlocked, your phone is useless, and all of your important photos, text messages, and content are all locked out of your reach. While right now, nothing can do without a Google account. But you can try to reset your Google account first.

A hard reset would be the best solution if you forgot your phone's lock screen password or pattern. However, you can unlock your phone with your Google account as well. Do a hard reset if you can't remember your Google account password and don't want to use third-party tools. The only problem with hard resetting is that you lose all your data, images, files, settings, and personalization.

Here are the steps for **Vivo Y55s 5G (2023)  pattern unlock without a PC** through a hard reset.
