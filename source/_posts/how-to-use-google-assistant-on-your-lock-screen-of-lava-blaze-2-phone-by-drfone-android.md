## Part 3: Bonus Tips

Gmail is undoubtedly a marvelous tool to use on Android devices, but have you really understood all the tips and tricks to take the best advantage of it? Below are the 5 most helpful tips that we want to offer you.

1. Far from your imagination, Gmail on Android devices is capable of allowing you to make use of several accounts at the same time, even if it's not a Gmail account. This performance not only helps you to organize your work better, but it also increase the efficiency of your job. Just simply log in your Gmail account on Gmail app, click on the down arrow which is placed next to your avatar and name, then choose Add account. You will be moved to another page, choose Personal (IMAP/POP) choice and follow the detailed guide on the screen.
2. If your Android device is used by only one user, and you are guaranteed about the security of it, try to keep the Gmail logged in. It would help you to avoid wasting unnecessary time to sign in your account every time you need, not to mention that it prevent you from being confused of not knowing your account/password.
3. You are capable of sorting your mails with a certain level of accuracy once you are fully aware of the features of Gmail app on Android devices. Just click on the email, then choose Settings menu and mark it as "Mark as not important", "Mark important" or "Report to spam" owing to the priority of your email.
4. Gmail app provided you with the ability to have conversations online, and whenever a message comes, there will be a sound. In case you are in a vital conference, or you don't want to be disturbed by the noise, you can mute it. All you have to do is to tap into the conversation, choose the three dots icon then click on the Mute option in the menu.
5. Enhance the speed and the accuracy of your search with the use of certain phrases. Let's take an instance to see what Gmail can do for you in this case. If you want to search for the mails which have been sent by a certain person, typefrom:(name of the person on Gmail) in the searching bar. And in case you would love to look for a private message from that person, please type is:chat:(name of the person on Gmail) .
