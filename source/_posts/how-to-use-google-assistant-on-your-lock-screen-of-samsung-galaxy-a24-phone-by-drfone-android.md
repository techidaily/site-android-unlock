Google Assistant is a virtual assistant powered by artificial intelligence (AI) developed by tech giant Google. This application is readily available on most recent mobile phone models, especially those operating on Android 6.0 and newer versions.

Although you can no longer use the **Google Assistant unlock** feature, you can still perform a myriad of tasks using Google Assistant. These include:

Once Google Assistant is active, issue a voice command related to the task you want to perform. For example:
