## Part 1. What You Can Do With Voice Google Assistant

Google Assistant is a virtual assistant powered by artificial intelligence (AI) developed by tech giant Google. This application is readily available on most recent mobile phone models, especially those operating on Android 6.0 and newer versions.

Although you can no longer use the **Google Assistant unlock** feature, you can still perform a myriad of tasks using Google Assistant. These include:

- Getting the weather
- Setting alarms
- Playing music
- Sending texts
- Making a call
- Asking Google for information, etc.

### Enable Google Assistant on Lock Screen: A Step-by-Step Guide

Now that you're eager to try the potential of Google Assistant on your lock screen, let's walk through the simple steps on how to enable this tool.

- **Step 1:** Open Google Assistant:

Look for "Google Assistant" and open the app.

- **Step 2:** Ask Google Assistant to open the settings.

You can ask, "Hey Google, open the Google Assistant settings," and it will show you the Google Assistant settings.

## Part 2. How To Use Google Assistant on Lock Screen

After you've successfully enabled Google Assistant on your lock screen, let's see how to use Google Assistant to do certain tasks more efficiently and hands-free.

- **Step 1:** Wake Up Google Assistant

Start by waking up Google Assistant. You can do this by saying the wake word "Hey Google" or "OK Google." If it doesn’t work, you can long-press the home button or use any dedicated gesture to activate Google Assistant.

- **Step 2:** Issue a Voice Command

Once Google Assistant is active, issue a voice command related to the task you want to perform. For example:

"Hey Google, what's the weather today?"

"OK Google, set an alarm for 5 PM."

"Hey Google, play my Spotify playlist."

When you can still **unlock with Google Assistant**, you can ask it to “unlock my phone” or use any similar command.

- **Step 3:** Interact with Responses

Google Assistant will then provide spoken responses and display relevant information on the lock screen. For instance, if you ask for the weather, it might verbally provide the current conditions and display a brief summary on your lock screen.

## Part 3. Common Problems When Using Google Assistant

Unable to use **Google Assistant to unlock phone** is not the only drawback that users may have encountered in recent changes. Although Google Assistant on the lock screen presents a revolutionary way to interact with your phone, like any technology, it also comes with its share of challenges. Some of the common problems when using Google Assistant are:

1. **Misunderstandings and misinterpretations**

One prevalent issue users encounter is Google Assistant misunderstanding or misinterpreting voice commands. This can be influenced by factors such as background noise, accent variations, or pronunciation differences.

2. **Limited context understanding**

While Google Assistant is adept at understanding individual commands, it may struggle with complex, multi-step requests that rely heavily on context. Break down your tasks into simpler commands to enhance comprehension and execute it more accurately.

3. **Inability to execute certain tasks**

Google Assistant's capabilities are extensive, but there are instances where it may struggle to execute specific tasks. For example, it can’t execute tasks that involve interacting with certain third-party applications or services. You can't also **unlock phone with voice Google Assistant.**

![Giving command to Google Asisstant on lock screen](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/unlock-phone-with-voice-google-assistant-4.jpg)

### Tips to Make Voice Google Assistant Recognize Your Commands

One of the most infuriating problems with voice Google Assistant is that users often encounter difficulties in having their commands accurately recognized. To enhance the accuracy of voice recognition with Google Assistant, you can consider implementing the following tips:

1. **Speak Clearly and Naturally**

Make sure that you speak in a clear and natural manner. Avoid mumbling or speaking too quickly. Enunciate your words, giving Google Assistant a better chance to interpret your commands accurately.

2. **Use Simple and Direct Phrases**

Keep your commands simple and direct. Avoid unnecessary elaboration or complex sentence structures. Google Assistant is more likely to understand straightforward commands.

3. **Check Your Microphone**

Ensure that your device's microphone is in good working condition. Dirt or debris on your phone's microphone can affect its performance. Clean the microphone area and try again.

4. **Quiet Environment**

Background noise can interfere with voice recognition. Try to issue commands in a quiet environment to minimize any potential confusion caused by external sounds.
