Once Google Assistant is active, issue a voice command related to the task you want to perform. For example:

Google Assistant will then provide spoken responses and display relevant information on the lock screen. For instance, if you ask for the weather, it might verbally provide the current conditions and display a brief summary on your lock screen.
