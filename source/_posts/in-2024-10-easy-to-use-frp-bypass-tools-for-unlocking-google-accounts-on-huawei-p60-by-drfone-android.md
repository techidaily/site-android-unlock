However, if you have access to a cell phone's GPS coordinates or the location of a cell tower to which it is linked, you can use Google Earth to follow its location.

### How To Locate a Smartphone Using Google Earth

Many current smartphones include GPS receivers that allow them to pinpoint their exact location. If you know the phone's GPS coordinates, you can plug them into Google Earth to see where it is on the map.

- **Step 1:** This process won't be possible if your location services are not enabled on your phone. To do this, navigate to **Settings,** then **Location** on Android, and **Settings** > **Privacy** > **Location Services** on iOS.

![iphone location services](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/09/track-imei-number-through-google-earth-02.jpg)

- **Step 2:** Google Earth can be downloaded and installed on your computer or mobile device. It works with Windows, macOS, Android, and iOS. Download it from your device's **Google Earth** website or the app store.

![install google earth android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/09/track-imei-number-through-google-earth-03.jpg)

- **Step 3:** Sign in to Google Earth using the Google Account linked to the phone you want to track. This step is required to acquire location data and [monitor IMEI numbers](https://drfone.wondershare.com/android-unlock/check-imei-number-location.html) using Google Earth.
- **Step 4:** Launch Google Earth on your computer or mobile device, then select **Your timeline** from the Google Maps menu. The operation will take you to the Google Maps Timeline page.

![your timeline on google maps](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/09/track-imei-number-through-google-earth-04.jpg)

- **Step 5:** Select the day you wish to see the phone's location history. Choose the Huawei P60 device you want to track from the dropdown menu if you have numerous devices linked to the same account. The timeline displays the selected device's location history for the set date. Examine the locations visited, the routes taken, and the time spent at each spot. For further information, select a certain location or time.

## Part 1: How to bypass forgot pattern lock using the 'Forgot Pattern' feature?

One of the easiest and fastest ways to fix the forgot pattern lock issue on a device is by using its inbuilt “Forgot Pattern” feature. If you are using an Android 4.4 or earlier version, then you can simply access this feature. Since users can hack an Android device just by knowing the Google credentials of the connected device, the solution was later discontinued (as it was considered a security vulnerability). Nevertheless, if your device hasn’t been updated and you are using an Android 4.4 or previous version, then you can bypass the forgot pattern lock by following these steps:

**Step 1.** Firstly, provide the wrong pattern to your device. It will let you know that you applied the incorrect pattern.

**Step 2.** On the same prompt, you can see an option of “Forgot pattern” on the bottom. Simply tap on it.

![forgot pattern](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/09/15059289368742.jpg)

**Step 3.** This will open a new screen, which can be used to bypass the forgotten pattern of Android. Select the option for entering the Google Account details and proceed.

**Step 4.** To reset the forgot pattern lock, you need to provide the correct Google credentials of the account already linked to the Huawei P60 device.

**Step 5.** After signing in to the interface, you will be asked to provide a new pattern lock for the Huawei P60 device.

![draw an unlock pattern](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/09/15059290477717.jpg)

**Step 6.** Confirm your choice and set a new pattern lock on your device.

## Part 2: How to get past forgot pattern lock using Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (Android)?

One of the major drawbacks of the “Forgot pattern” feature is that it doesn’t work on new Android devices. Since most of the Huawei P60 devices out there have been updated, the technique has been outdated. Therefore, you can simply take the assistance of [Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (Android)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare-dr-fone-unlock-android-screen/) to bypass the forgot pattern lock on your device. Without causing any harm to your device or erasing its data, your device’s password or pattern would be removed.

It is a part of the Dr.Fone toolkit and is compatible with all the leading Android devices out there. It can be used to remove passwords, patterns, pins, and more. It has an easy-to-use interface and provides a simple click-through process to resolve the forgot pattern Android lock on your device. However, this tool merely retains all the data after unlocking Samsung and LG screens. Other Android locked screens can also be unlocked, and the only thing is that it will wipe all the data after unlocking.
