## Part 1: Lock System About Huawei Nova Y71  

### 1: Lock Types

Before we move towards the **Huawei Nova Y71  pattern unlock**, let's talk about its lock types and security system. Huawei Nova Y71  is one of the older versions of Huawei  android phones that was released in 2016. At that time, only flagship phones from each brand came with features like fingerprint sensors and facial unlock. Huawei Nova Y71  doesn't offer these lock types. You can only set up a screen lock as a password, pattern, and PIN. You can also lock apps on Huawei Nova Y71  with its privacy password settings.
