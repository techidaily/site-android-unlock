### 1: Lock Types

Before we move towards the **Lava Storm 5G  pattern unlock**, let's talk about its lock types and security system. Lava Storm 5G  is one of the older versions of Lava  android phones that was released in 2016. At that time, only flagship phones from each brand came with features like fingerprint sensors and facial unlock. Lava Storm 5G  doesn't offer these lock types. You can only set up a screen lock as a password, pattern, and PIN. You can also lock apps on Lava Storm 5G  with its privacy password settings.

### 2: How to Set Them up?

Follow these steps to set up any type of lock on your Lava Storm 5G  .

- Open “Settings” on your mobile and select "Lockscreen and Password".

- Select the "Lockscreen Password" option at the top and tap on the "Enable Lock Screen" button.
- Select the type of lock you want to set and create a password.

### 4: Hard Reset (data loss)

A hard reset would be the best solution if you forgot your phone's lock screen password or pattern. However, you can unlock your phone with your Google account as well. Do a hard reset if you can't remember your Google account password and don't want to use third-party tools. The only problem with hard resetting is that you lose all your data, images, files, settings, and personalization. That is why you can't recover any of your data after the hard reset if you don't have a data backup. The process of hard reset is different for every device. Here are the steps for **Lava Storm 5G  pattern unlock without a PC** through a hard reset.

- Switch off your Lava Storm 5G  with the power button.
