### 1: Lock Types

Before we move towards the **Lava Yuva 3 Pro  pattern unlock**, let's talk about its lock types and security system. Lava Yuva 3 Pro  is one of the older versions of Lava  android phones that was released in 2016. At that time, only flagship phones from each brand came with features like fingerprint sensors and facial unlock. Lava Yuva 3 Pro  doesn't offer these lock types. You can only set up a screen lock as a password, pattern, and PIN. You can also lock apps on Lava Yuva 3 Pro  with its privacy password settings.

### 2: How to Set Them up?

Follow these steps to set up any type of lock on your Lava Yuva 3 Pro  .

- Open “Settings” on your mobile and select "Lockscreen and Password".
- The lock system menu would appear if your device had no screen locks. If your device has a screen lock, you will have to enter the password to enter the settings.
- Select the "Lockscreen Password" option at the top and tap on the "Enable Lock Screen" button.
- Select the type of lock you want to set and create a password.

### 3: How to Remove Them with Password or Pattern?

You can easily remove the lock screen of your Lava Yuva 3 Pro  if you remember your password or pattern.

- Go to “Settings” and follow the previous steps to open the "Lockscreen Password" settings.

This method does not work on all Lava  devices, but you can use it for **Lava Yuva 3 Pro  screen unlock without PC**. You will see various questions if your Google account is linked with the Lava Yuva 3 Pro device. All questions are based on your profile and credentials. You have to answer precisely with proper spaces. Here are the steps to unlock Lava Yuva 3 Pro  with security questions.

### 4: Hard Reset (data loss)

A hard reset would be the best solution if you forgot your phone's lock screen password or pattern. However, you can unlock your phone with your Google account as well. Do a hard reset if you can't remember your Google account password and don't want to use third-party tools. The only problem with hard resetting is that you lose all your data, images, files, settings, and personalization. That is why you can't recover any of your data after the hard reset if you don't have a data backup. The process of hard reset is different for every device. Here are the steps for **Lava Yuva 3 Pro  pattern unlock without a PC** through a hard reset.

- Switch off your Lava Yuva 3 Pro  with the power button.

You can either try Google’s native solution or a third-party tool in case you have forgotten the pattern lock on your device and reset it. In no time, you will be able to access your device (or even someone else’s phone by following these techniques). To make things easier for you, we have provided three simple solutions to resolve forgotten patterns on Android devices.

## Part 1: How to bypass forgot pattern lock using the 'Forgot Pattern' feature?

One of the easiest and fastest ways to fix the forgot pattern lock issue on a device is by using its inbuilt “Forgot Pattern” feature. If you are using an Android 4.4 or earlier version, then you can simply access this feature. Since users can hack an Android device just by knowing the Google credentials of the connected device, the solution was later discontinued (as it was considered a security vulnerability). Nevertheless, if your device hasn’t been updated and you are using an Android 4.4 or previous version, then you can bypass the forgot pattern lock by following these steps:

**Step 1.** Firstly, provide the wrong pattern to your device. It will let you know that you applied the incorrect pattern.

**Step 2.** On the same prompt, you can see an option of “Forgot pattern” on the bottom. Simply tap on it.
