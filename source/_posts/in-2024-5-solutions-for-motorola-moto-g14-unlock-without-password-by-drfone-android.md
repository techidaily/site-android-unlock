A hard reset would be the best solution if you forgot your phone's lock screen password or pattern. However, you can unlock your phone with your Google account as well. Do a hard reset if you can't remember your Google account password and don't want to use third-party tools.

Here are the steps for **Motorola Moto G14  pattern unlock without a PC** through a hard reset.

- Switch off your Motorola Moto G14  with the power button.
