With a hard reset, you lose all your data and settings. It is not worth it if all you want to do is unlock your screen. Here are the steps to unlock Oppo A18  with Find My Device.

Here are the steps for **Oppo A18  pattern unlock without a PC** through a hard reset.

- Switch off your Oppo A18  with the power button.

## Top Apps and Online Tools To Track Oppo A18 Phone [With/Without IMEI Number]

Losing your smartphone can be distressing, given its importance in daily life. Ensuring the ability to trace the whereabouts of a misplaced device holds great importance. It is due to potential theft, loss, or accidental misplacement.

Fortunately, many ways exist to retrieve a lost mobile phone by utilizing its IMEI number. This article will take you through the **anti-theft app & IMEI tracker of all phone location** methods. Additionally, we will discuss a unique tool designed to unlock locked devices.
