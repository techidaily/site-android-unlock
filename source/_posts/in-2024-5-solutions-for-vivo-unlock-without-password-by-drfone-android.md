## Part 1: Lock System About Vivo S18e  

### 1: Lock Types

Before we move towards the **Vivo S18e  pattern unlock**, let's talk about its lock types and security system. Vivo S18e  is one of the older versions of Vivo  android phones that was released in 2016. At that time, only flagship phones from each brand came with features like fingerprint sensors and facial unlock. Vivo S18e  doesn't offer these lock types. You can only set up a screen lock as a password, pattern, and PIN. You can also lock apps on Vivo S18e  with its privacy password settings.

### 2: How to Set Them up?

Follow these steps to set up any type of lock on your Vivo S18e  .

- Open “Settings” on your mobile and select "Lockscreen and Password".
- The lock system menu would appear if your device had no screen locks. If your device has a screen lock, you will have to enter the password to enter the settings.
- Select the "Lockscreen Password" option at the top and tap on the "Enable Lock Screen" button.
- Select the type of lock you want to set and create a password.

You can use the Google Find My Device for your **Vivo S18e  pattern unlock**. It is a simple privacy and security Google feature that enables users to reset their android phones. Most people use it to factory reset their phones when someone steals their phones. Although Google Find My Device works every time, it is not the ideal solution if you don't want to lose your data. With a hard reset, you lose all your data and settings. It is not worth it if all you want to do is unlock your screen. Here are the steps to unlock Vivo S18e  with Find My Device.

Here are the steps for **Vivo S18e  pattern unlock without a PC** through a hard reset.

- Switch off your Vivo S18e  with the power button.
