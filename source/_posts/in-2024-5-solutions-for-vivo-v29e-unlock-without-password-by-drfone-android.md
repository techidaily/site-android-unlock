### 1: Lock Types

Before we move towards the **Vivo V29e  pattern unlock**, let's talk about its lock types and security system. Vivo V29e  is one of the older versions of Vivo  android phones that was released in 2016. At that time, only flagship phones from each brand came with features like fingerprint sensors and facial unlock. Vivo V29e  doesn't offer these lock types. You can only set up a screen lock as a password, pattern, and PIN. You can also lock apps on Vivo V29e  with its privacy password settings.

Here are the steps to unlock Vivo V29e  with security questions.

Do a hard reset if you can't remember your Google account password and don't want to use third-party tools.

Here are the steps for **Vivo V29e  pattern unlock without a PC** through a hard reset.

![Minimal adb and fastboot open command](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/06/14648313653169.jpg)

**Step 6.** ADB terminal will pop out. Now, the first is to type in ADB _devices_. This is to check if your device is recognized by ADB. If there is no device listed below, try to remove and reconnect your Vivo V29e and retype the command. If there are listed devices already, proceed.

- _adb shell_
- _cd /data/data/com.android.providers.settings/databases_
- _sqlite3 settings.db_
- _update system set value=0 where_
- _name='lock\_pattern\_autolock';_
- _update system set value=0 where_
- _name='lockscreen.lockedoutpermanently';_
- _.quit_

![Minimal adb and fastboot adb shell command](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/06/14648317729484.jpg)

This would work if you have your USB debugging turned on before it was locked. That's how to unlock Android using ADB.
