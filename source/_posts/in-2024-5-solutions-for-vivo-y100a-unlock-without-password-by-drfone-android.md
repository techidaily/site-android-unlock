## Part 1: Lock System About Vivo Y100A  

### 1: Lock Types

Before we move towards the **Vivo Y100A  pattern unlock**, let's talk about its lock types and security system. Vivo Y100A  is one of the older versions of Vivo  android phones that was released in 2016. At that time, only flagship phones from each brand came with features like fingerprint sensors and facial unlock. Vivo Y100A  doesn't offer these lock types. You can only set up a screen lock as a password, pattern, and PIN. You can also lock apps on Vivo Y100A  with its privacy password settings.

### 2: How to Set Them up?

Follow these steps to set up any type of lock on your Vivo Y100A  .

- Open “Settings” on your mobile and select "Lockscreen and Password".
- The lock system menu would appear if your device had no screen locks. If your device has a screen lock, you will have to enter the password to enter the settings.
- Select the "Lockscreen Password" option at the top and tap on the "Enable Lock Screen" button.
- Select the type of lock you want to set and create a password.

### 3: How to Remove Them with Password or Pattern?

## Part 2: 5 Solutions to Unlock Vivo Y100A  Without Password or Pattern

Most people use it to factory reset their phones when someone steals their phones. Although Google Find My Device works every time, it is not the ideal solution if you don't want to lose your data. With a hard reset, you lose all your data and settings. It is not worth it if all you want to do is unlock your screen. Here are the steps to unlock Vivo Y100A  with Find My Device.

This method does not work on all Vivo  devices, but you can use it for **Vivo Y100A  screen unlock without PC**.

Here are the steps to unlock Vivo Y100A  with security questions.

Do a hard reset if you can't remember your Google account password and don't want to use third-party tools. The only problem with hard resetting is that you lose all your data, images, files, settings, and personalization. That is why you can't recover any of your data after the hard reset if you don't have a data backup. The process of hard reset is different for every device. Here are the steps for **Vivo Y100A  pattern unlock without a PC** through a hard reset.

- Switch off your Vivo Y100A  with the power button.

## How to Remove Operator Lock on Vivo Y100A ?

An operator lock, also called a carrier lock, constitutes a limitation imposed on a mobile phone by a network provider. This measure is implemented to guarantee that the Vivo Y100A device exclusively functions with the services provided by that specific carrier. If you wish to remove the operator lock from your Vivo Y100A  device, you'll need to follow specific steps and meet certain criteria. Here's how to remove the operator lock on a Vivo Y100A :
