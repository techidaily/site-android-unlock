## Part 1: Lock System About Vivo Y56 5G  

### 1: Lock Types

Before we move towards the **Vivo Y56 5G  pattern unlock**, let's talk about its lock types and security system.

You can only set up a screen lock as a password, pattern, and PIN. You can also lock apps on Vivo Y56 5G  with its privacy password settings.

### 2: How to Set Them up?

Follow these steps to set up any type of lock on your Vivo Y56 5G  .

- Open “Settings” on your mobile and select "Lockscreen and Password".
- The lock system menu would appear if your device had no screen locks. If your device has a screen lock, you will have to enter the password to enter the settings.
- Select the "Lockscreen Password" option at the top and tap on the "Enable Lock Screen" button.
- Select the type of lock you want to set and create a password.

### 3: How to Remove Them with Password or Pattern?
