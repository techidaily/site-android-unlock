## Rootjunky APK To Bypass Google FRP Lock For Vivo S17t 

Factory Reset Protection (FRP) is a security feature built into Android devices running Android 5.1 Lollipop and later versions. It prevents someone from using your phone after a factory data reset without Google account login credentials. The FRP makes it much less attractive for thieves to steal Android phones, knowing they will need help to access them.

FRP automatically activates when you add a Google account to your Android phone. It links the Vivo S17t device to your account, making it the “trusted owner.” Once activated, FRP becomes embedded in the phone’s system.

While Google FRP is a valuable security feature, it’s vital to acknowledge that there are legitimate situations where bypassing it might be necessary. These instances include forgotten Google account credentials, buying a second-hand device, and device issues. In these cases, tools like **RootJunky** can help you [<u>bypass FRP Lock</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/google-frp-unlock/bypass-frp-with-computer.html).

## How To Remove Screen Lock PIN On Vivo S17t Like A Pro: 5 Easy Ways

When protecting personal information on your phone, setting up a lock screen is essential. If you've ever forgotten your screen lock PIN on Android, you know how frustrating it can be to get back into your device. If you've ever tried to remove the screen lock PIN on an Android device, you know it's not that easy.

It depends on your phone and the type of lock code you have set up. Note that this will erase all your data from the phone, so be sure to back it up first. This post will teach you how to remove the screen lock PIN on Android devices using several methods. So if you cannot use your device, keep reading for the steps!

![remove forgotten screen lock pin](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/how-to-remove-screen-lock-pin-on-android-1.jpg)

## Part 1: How To Remove Screen Lock PIN On Vivo S17t? 5 Simple Ways

If you've forgotten your screen lock pin, there's no need to worry. Here are quick and easy ways to remove the screen lock PIN on your Android device.

### 1\. Change or Remove in Settings

When you go to Settings > Lock Screen > Screen lock type, several lock screen options are available. These options are given below:

**Swipe:**

You can unlock your phone by swiping in any direction on its screen.

**Pattern:**

You will draw a pattern on a 3-by-3 grid of dots to unlock your phone this way. To do this, you'll need to use your finger to connect the dots in the pattern.

**Phone Pin:**

When you choose a PIN, make sure it's something easy to remember. But choose wisely- a PIN that's too easy to guess can put your account at risk.

**Password:**

It is the highest level of security available for your phone. Passwords should contain seven characters, of which at least one must be a letter. They should also be both unique and memorable.

**Face recognition:**

By holding your face directly in front of the phone screen, you can unlock your phone and verify yourself in apps.

**Fingerprints:**

Touch your phone to open it quickly and easily.

**Iris:**

Verify that only the contents of your phone are visible to your eyes.

**Intelligent Scan:**

Unlock your device with both facial and iris recognition.
