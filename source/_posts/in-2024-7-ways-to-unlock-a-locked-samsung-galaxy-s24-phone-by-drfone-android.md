- Step 2. Accept the call and press the back button without disconnecting.
- Step 3. Now you can access the Samsung Galaxy S24 device completely
- Step 4. Go to the security settings of the Samsung Galaxy S24 device and remove the pattern or pin.
- Step 5. It will ask you the correct pin that you don't know, guess, and try various combinations you can recall.

To avoid forgetting your password or PIN next time, be sure to write the pattern or numbers on a text file or paper to keep them safe. If you have to bypass the Samsung lock screen pattern, PIN, password, and fingerprint, you may consider using Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (Android). It is a professional tool that can remove all the fingerprints, pattern, and password lock screens without losing any data on your phone.
