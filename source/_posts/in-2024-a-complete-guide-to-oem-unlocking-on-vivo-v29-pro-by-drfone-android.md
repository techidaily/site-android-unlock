## A Complete Guide To OEM Unlocking on Vivo V29 Pro

Android, known worldwide as a major player in phone operating systems, stands out for its flexibility and open-source nature. This allows users to customize their devices extensively. However, despite this openness, certain features and capabilities can still be locked or restricted, either by Google or the Vivo V29 Pro device manufacturer.

For those looking to truly unleash the full potential of their Android device, an OEM unlock is an essential step. This article will delve into the process of **OEM unlocking on Android**, guiding you through its benefits and how to safely perform it.

![android phone with padlock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/what-is-oem-unlock-01.jpg)

**OEM lock** might sound like technical jargon to many. However, it’s a key concept for those who wish to dive deeper into Android customization. OEM stands for Original Equipment Manufacturer. Unlocking in this context refers to removing restrictions made by the manufacturer on the Vivo V29 Pro device.

This process allows you to gain deeper access to the Vivo V29 Pro device’s software. Thus, OEM unlocking is often required for customizing or modifying the system at a more advanced level.

### Why Enable OEM Unlock?

The primary reason to enable **OEM unlocking** is to gain the ability to root your device or install custom firmware, also known as ROMs. Rooting is the Android equivalent of jailbreaking. It allows users to access and modify the Vivo V29 Pro device’s software at the deepest level.

This can enable the installation of apps and software that require more permissions than what is typically available. On the other hand, custom ROMs can change your device’s interface. They can also add features not available in the stock version of Android.

### Pros and Cons of OEM Unlocking

Here are some great things you can get when you **allow OEM unlock.**

- The most significant advantage is the ability to customize your device far beyond what’s possible with standard settings.
- **Root access.** It allows for rooting the phone enabling advanced features and apps.
- **Custom ROMs.** Users can install different versions of Android or entirely new operating systems.

On the other hand, here are some cons that you must consider before performing the process on your phone:

- **Security risks.** Root access can make your device more vulnerable to malware and hacking.
- **Void warranty.** OEM unlocking often voids the manufacturer’s warranty.
- **Potential for bricking.** Incorrect procedures can render the Vivo V29 Pro device unusable, known as ‘bricking’.

### Understanding the Risks

It’s crucial to understand that OEM unlocking is not without its risks. It does open the door to several customizations and tweaks. However, it can also compromise the security of your device. There’s always a chance of bricking your phone, especially if the unlocking process isn’t followed correctly or an unstable custom ROM is installed.

Additionally, most manufacturers will void your warranty once you unlock the bootloader. This leaves you without support in case something goes wrong. So, in the next sections, you’ll be guided through the steps of OEM unlocking. You’ll also learn how to do it safely, ensuring you make the most out of your Android device.

## Part 2: How To Enable OEM Unlock on Your Android Phone

**Enabling OEM unlock** can feel like stepping into uncharted territory. Still, it’s relatively straightforward if you follow the right steps. Before you start, it’s important to remember that the exact process can vary slightly depending on your device’s brand and model. However, the general steps are usually similar across most Android devices.

![android developer options](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/what-is-oem-unlock-03.jpg)

- **Step 1:** Before proceeding, ensure you [<u>back up all important data</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/backup/android-backup-software.html). Enabling OEM unlock may require a factory reset, which erases all data on the Vivo V29 Pro device.
- **Step 2:** Go to your phone’s Settings > About Phone. Then, tap on the Build number seven times. You should see a message that says you’re now a developer.
- **Step 3:** Find and select Developer options on Settings. Then, tap **OEM unlocking**. You might need to enter a PIN or password.

Here are some common links where you might find the needed PIN or password:

- [<u>HTC</u>](https://www.htcdev.com/bootloader/)
- [<u>LG</u>](https://developer.lge.com/resource/mobile/RetrieveBootloader.dev?categoryTypeCode=ANRS)
- [<u>Sony</u>](https://developer.sonymobile.com/unlockbootloader/unlock-yourboot-loader/)
- [<u>Huawei</u>](https://community.gethuawei.com/developers/f/48/t/1048)
- [<u>Motorola</u>](https://www.motorola.com/https://accounts.motorola.com/ssoauth/login?TARGET=https://motorola-global-portal.custhelp.com/cc/cas/sso/redirect/standalone%2Fbootloader%2Funlock-your-device-b)
- [<u>Samsung</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/samsung-unlock-codes.html)

After these steps, your device’s bootloader is now unlocked, and you can proceed with rooting or installing custom ROMs. Remember that this is a significant change to your device’s system, and it should be done cautiously and ideally only if you’re comfortable with potential risks.

## Part 3: What Can You Do After OEM Unlock?

Unlocking your phone’s OEM opens up a world of possibilities. It allows you to customize your device beyond what’s available in its factory settings. This newfound freedom, however, comes with its own set of responsibilities and risks. Here’s what you can do after having your phone **OEM unlocked**.

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://printrendy.pxf.io/c/5597632/1453719/17020" target="_top" id="1453719"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17020-1453719" border="0" alt="" width="300" height="250"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1453719/17020" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![android custom roms](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/what-is-oem-unlock-04.jpg)

### Root Your Device

Rooting is akin to having the master key to your device’s software. It allows you to gain superuser access, enabling modifications and access to system files that were previously restricted. With rooting, you can:

- Remove pre-installed apps or bloatware.
- Customize system settings and UI elements.
- Enhance performance or battery life through underclocking or overclocking the CPU.

### Flash a Custom ROM

A custom ROM is a new operating system you can install on your device. This is one of the most popular reasons for OEM unlocking. Custom ROMs offer:

- The latest Android updates, even for older devices, are no longer supported by manufacturers.
- New features and customization options that aren’t available in the stock ROM.
- Potential performance improvements and unique user interfaces.

### Enjoy High Customization

With an OEM unlocked device, the sky’s the limit regarding customization. You can:

- Install custom kernels for better performance and battery life.
- Use powerful apps that require root access for advanced device management.
- Customize everything from the boot animation to the layout of your UI.

However, it’s crucial to proceed with caution. Rooting and installing custom ROMs can void your warranty and, if not done correctly, can turn your device into an expensive paperweight (a state often referred to as “bricking”). Always use reliable sources for your custom ROMs and root-access apps.

## Solution 3: Unlock the Vivo Phone Using Google Login (only Android 4.4 and below)

If your Vivo device runs on Android 4.4 and previous versions, then you can easily move past the password/pattern lock without any trouble. The provision is not available on devices, which run on newer versions of Android. Nevertheless, for all the Vivo V29 Pro devices running on older versions than Android 4.4, this is undoubtedly the easiest way to set a new passcode. Follow these steps to learn how to unlock your Vivo phone if you forgot your password using your Google credentials.

- **Step 1.** Try bypassing the pattern lock at least 5 times. After all the failed attempts, you will get the option to either make an emergency call or choose the option of “**Forget pattern**”.

![unlock lg forgot password - forgot pattern](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/03/14892203178747.jpg)

- **Step 2.** Select the “Forget pattern” option and provide the correct credentials of your Google account to unlock your phone.

![unlock lg forgot password - log in google account](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/03/14892203377058.jpg)

## Solution 4: Unlock the Vivo Phone Using Custom Recovery (SD card needed)

If your phone has a removable SD card, you can also try this technique to disable the pattern/password on your device. Though, you need to have some custom recovery installed on your device for this method. You can always go for TWRP (Team Win Recovery Project) and flash it on your device.

TWRP: <https://twrp.me/>

Also, since you can't move anything to your device when it is locked, you need to do the same using its SD card. After ensuring that you have met all the basic prerequisites, follow these steps and learn how to unlock the Vivo phone's forgotten password using a custom recovery.

- **Step 1.** Download a [Pattern Password Disable](http://forum.xda-developers.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=2532214&d=1390399283) application and save its ZIP file on your computer. Now, insert your SD card into your system and move the recently downloaded file to it.

- **Step 2.** Reboot your phone into recovery mode. For instance, the TWRP recovery mode can be turned on by simultaneously pressing the Power, Home, and Volume Up button. You would get different options on your screen after entering the custom recovery mode. Tap on “Install” and browse the Pattern Password Disable application file.

![unlock lg forgot password - team win recovery project](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/03/14892204165153.jpg)

- **Step 3.** Install the above-mentioned application and wait for a few minutes. Afterward, restart your Vivo phone. Ideally, your phone will be restarted without any lock screen. If you get a lock screen, you can bypass it by entering any random digits.

## Solution 5: Factory Reset Vivo Phone in Recovery Mode (erases all phone data)

If none of the above-mentioned alternatives work, then you can also try to factory reset your device. This will erase every kind of data from your device and make it look brand new by resetting it. Though, you can easily resolve the forgot password on the Vivo phone with it. Therefore, before proceeding, you need to be familiar with all the repercussions of performing a factory reset. All you got to do is follow these steps.

- **Step 1.** Put your Vivo phone on its recovery mode with correct key combinations. To do this, firstly, turn your device off and let it rest for a few seconds. Now, press the Power and Volume Down key at the same time. Keep pressing them until you see LG's logo on the screen. Release the buttons for a few seconds and press them again at the same time. Again, keep pressing the buttons until you see the recovery mode menu. This technique works with most Vivo devices, but it can differ slightly from one model to another.

- **Step 2.** Choose “Wipe Data/Factory Reset.” You can use the Volume up and down key to navigate the options and the power/home key to select anything. Use these keys and select the “Wipe Data/Factory Reset” option. You might get another pop-up asking to delete all user data. Just agree it reset your device. Sit back and relax as your device will perform a hard reset.

![unlock lg forgot password - enter in recovery mode](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/03/14892204518630.jpg)

- **Step 3.** Select the “Reboot system now” option to restart it. Your phone will be restarted without any lock screen.

## Solution 6: Unlock Vivo Phone Using ADB Command (need USB debugging enabled)

This might be a little complicated initially, but if you don't want to follow either of the above-mentioned techniques to unlock your device, you can go with this alternative. Before proceeding, make sure that you have ADB (Android Debug Bridge) installed on your computer. If you don't have it, then you can download Android SDK right [here](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html).

Additionally, it would help if you turned on the USB Debugging feature on your phone before you forgot the password. If USB debugging is not turned on before, then this method will not work for you.

After making your device ready and downloading all the essential software on your computer, follow these steps to learn how to unlock your Vivo phone if you forgot the password.

- **Step 1.** Connect your device to the computer with a USB cable and open the command prompt when it is successfully connected. If you get a pop-up message regarding USB Debugging permission on your device, simply agree to it and continue.

- **Step 2.** Now, please provide the following code on the command prompt and reboot your device when it is processed. If you want, you can also tweak the code a little and provide a new lock pin.

- _ADB_ _shell_
- _cd /data/data/com.android.providers.settings/databases_
- _sqlite3 settings.__db_
- _update system set value=0 where name='lock\_pattern\_autolock';_
- _update system set value=0 where name='lockscreen__.lockedoutpermanently';_
- _.quit_
