### 4\. Preference for Third-Party Tools

Certain users might have a preference for specialized third-party password management tools. They can go for solutions that offer a wider array of features. Many users might want to find options better aligned with their specific needs. This prompts them to disable Google Smart Lock.

## Part 1: How To Remove Screen Lock PIN On HTC U23? 5 Simple Ways

If you've forgotten your screen lock pin, there's no need to worry. Here are quick and easy ways to remove the screen lock PIN on your Android device.

### 1\. Change or Remove in Settings

When you go to Settings > Lock Screen > Screen lock type, several lock screen options are available. These options are given below:

**Swipe:**

You can unlock your phone by swiping in any direction on its screen.

**Pattern:**

You will draw a pattern on a 3-by-3 grid of dots to unlock your phone this way. To do this, you'll need to use your finger to connect the dots in the pattern.

**Phone Pin:**

When you choose a PIN, make sure it's something easy to remember. But choose wisely- a PIN that's too easy to guess can put your account at risk.

**Password:**

It is the highest level of security available for your phone. Passwords should contain seven characters, of which at least one must be a letter. They should also be both unique and memorable.

**Face recognition:**

By holding your face directly in front of the phone screen, you can unlock your phone and verify yourself in apps.

**Fingerprints:**

Touch your phone to open it quickly and easily.

**Iris:**

Verify that only the contents of your phone are visible to your eyes.

**Intelligent Scan:**

Unlock your device with both facial and iris recognition.
