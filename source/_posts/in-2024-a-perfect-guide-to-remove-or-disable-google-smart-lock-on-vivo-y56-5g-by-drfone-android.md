Some users focus on privacy and feel uncomfortable with Google Smart Lock's access to their passwords. The reason behind this is how easily anyone can access the saved password. All they need to do is access "Manage Passwords" in Google Chrome, and all their passwords will be open. This leads them to opt for more private password management options.

### 2\. Glitches and Technical Issues

Technical glitches in the functioning of Google Smart Lock can be frustrating. This is especially prominent when managing passwords with similar usernames across different websites. The same can happen when using similar passwords for different websites or apps. Users experiencing such issues can seek to remove it to restore regular operations.

### 3\. No Updates

You should be aware that Google Smart Lock for Passwords has been deprecated. This indicates it no longer receives updates or support from Google. Developers are advised to opt for Google's One Tap Sign-in feature as an alternative by Google. It provides a more efficient and secure method for signing in to apps and websites.

### 4\. Preference for Third-Party Tools

Certain users might have a preference for specialized third-party password management tools. They can go for solutions that offer a wider array of features. Many users might want to find options better aligned with their specific needs. This prompts them to disable Google Smart Lock.

![Minimal adb and fastboot open command](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/06/14648313653169.jpg)

**Step 6.** ADB terminal will pop out. Now, the first is to type in ADB _devices_. This is to check if your device is recognized by ADB. If there is no device listed below, try to remove and reconnect your Vivo Y56 5G and retype the command. If there are listed devices already, proceed.

![Minimal adb and fastboot command window adb devices command](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/06/14648317691463.jpg)

**Step 7.** Finally, type in the following commands **one by one****.** These commands will remove your lock screen.

- _adb shell_
- _cd /data/data/com.android.providers.settings/databases_
- _sqlite3 settings.db_
- _update system set value=0 where_
- _name='lock\_pattern\_autolock';_
- _update system set value=0 where_
- _name='lockscreen.lockedoutpermanently';_
- _.quit_

![Minimal adb and fastboot adb shell command](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/06/14648317729484.jpg)

This would work if you have your USB debugging turned on before it was locked. That's how to unlock Android using ADB.

## Part 4: How to Unlock Phone via Find My Device (with Data Loss)

Google Find My Device is another handy way to unlock your locked Android device. However, it requires you to have your Google ID credentials and you have previously enabled Find My Device features.
