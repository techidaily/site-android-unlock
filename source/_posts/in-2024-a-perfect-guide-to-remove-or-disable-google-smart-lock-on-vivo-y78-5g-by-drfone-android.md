## Part 3. Why Is It Essential To Remove Google Smart Lock?

Despite its array of benefits, there are times when users consider removing or disabling Google Smart Lock. Described below are these limitations to better grasp why users might choose to **Google Smart Lock turn off**:

### 1\. Privacy Concerns

Some users focus on privacy and feel uncomfortable with Google Smart Lock's access to their passwords. The reason behind this is how easily anyone can access the saved password. All they need to do is access "Manage Passwords" in Google Chrome, and all their passwords will be open. This leads them to opt for more private password management options.

### 2\. Glitches and Technical Issues

Technical glitches in the functioning of Google Smart Lock can be frustrating. This is especially prominent when managing passwords with similar usernames across different websites. The same can happen when using similar passwords for different websites or apps. Users experiencing such issues can seek to remove it to restore regular operations.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 3\. No Updates

You should be aware that Google Smart Lock for Passwords has been deprecated. This indicates it no longer receives updates or support from Google. Developers are advised to opt for Google's One Tap Sign-in feature as an alternative by Google. It provides a more efficient and secure method for signing in to apps and websites.

### 4\. Preference for Third-Party Tools

Certain users might have a preference for specialized third-party password management tools. They can go for solutions that offer a wider array of features. Many users might want to find options better aligned with their specific needs. This prompts them to disable Google Smart Lock.

## Part 1: How to set up Pattern Lock Screen on Vivo Y78 5G?

Out of all the provided options for screen locks, pattern lock is mostly used due to its ease of access and added security. If you haven’t set up a screen lock pattern on your device, then we recommend you to do the same right away. Not only will it keep intruders away, it will also protect your privacy. To learn how to set up a lock screen pattern on an Android device, simply follow these steps:

- 1\. Firstly, unlock your device and go to its Settings. You can access it from the Home Screen or from its Notification Center.
- 2\. Under the personal or privacy section, you can access the “Lock Screen and Security” option.
- 3\. In some versions, the option is also listed right at the top of the settings (in its quick access).

![setup android pattern lock screen-unlock your device](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/09/15057378431872.jpg) ![setup android pattern lock screen-Under the personal or privacy section](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/09/15057378838236.jpg) ![setup android pattern lock screen-access Lock Screen and Security](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/09/15057379016188.jpg)

- 4\. To set up a pattern lock screen, tap on the “Screen lock type” feature.
- 5\. This will provide a list of all the different kinds of locks that you can apply. Ideally, it would be password, pin, pattern, swipe, or none. In “Swipe”, you can unlock a device just by swiping the screen. Whereas, in pattern, pin, or password, you would be needed to provide the respective pattern/pin/password to unlock the Vivo Y78 5G device.
- 6\. We recommend setting up a lock screen pattern instead. To do this, tap on the “Pattern” option.

- 7\. From the next screen, you can simply draw any kind of pattern of your choice. Ideally, it should join at least 4 dots on the screen. We recommend using a strong screen lock pattern to provide unmatched security to your device.
- 8\. Furthermore, you need to confirm your choice and provide the same pattern once again. Make sure that you draw the same pattern here.
- 9\. Additionally, the interface will ask you to provide a security pin as well. In case if you will forget your pattern, then you can access your phone by taking the assistance of this pin.

![setup android pattern lock screen](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/09/15057380143598.jpg) ![setup android pattern lock screen-provide the same pattern](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/09/15057380317550.jpg) ![setup android pattern lock screen-provide a security pin](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/09/15057380506350.jpg)

- 10\. Similarly, you would be required to confirm the pin as well to finish the setup.
- 11\. That’s it! By completing these steps, a screen lock pattern will be implemented on your device.

Later, you can follow the same drill to change your device’s lock screen pattern as well. Though, you would be needed to provide the existing pattern to access these features. Out of all the lock screen options, you should go with the pattern lock. Not only it is the most accessible option, it also provides fast results with an added security.
