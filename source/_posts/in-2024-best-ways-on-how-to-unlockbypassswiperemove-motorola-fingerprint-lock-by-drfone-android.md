This article will discuss 5 different ways on how to unlock **Motorola G24 Power  smartphone**. Some methods might work without erasing your data, while others, like factory resetting, may erase all content from your phone. Regardless of which method you use, you will be able to unlock your phone! So, let’s get started!

## 1\. How to Unlock Motorola G24 Power  With Google Find My Motorola G24 Power?

A way to unlock the Motorola G24 Power  phone is via Google Find My Device feature. While this method can help unlock your phone, it erases all content from it.

For this method, you need a PC and your Google account details. Here are the steps for it:

**Step 1:** Open your browser and go to [Google Find My Device](https://www.google.com/android/find) on your PC.

![google account verification](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/05/google-account-verification.jpg)

**Step 2:** Log in to the Google account you used to set up your Motorola G24 Power  phone.

**Step 3:** It will show you 3 options: Play Sound, Secure Device, and Erase Device.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 And then select “**Erase Device.**”

![select erase data](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/05/select-erase-device.jpg)

Selecting this option will erase all content from your device, including screen unlock PIN, password, and pattern.

**Step 4:** Now, you can access your phone without an unlock PIN or pattern and set a new one.

Use this method only if your phone is backed up so you can restore all your data later.

## 2\. How to Unlock Android device Using Lock Remove Tool?

Another foolproof method on how to unlock Android pattern lock is by using a lock removal tool like [Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (Android)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare-dr-fone-unlock-android-screen/).

<iframe allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QWpE8NykOWc"></iframe>
