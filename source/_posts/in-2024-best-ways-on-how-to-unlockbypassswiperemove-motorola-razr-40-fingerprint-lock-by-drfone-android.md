### iOS Devices

- **Step 1.** You need to turn on Finder if you own a macOS Catalina or later device. Conversely, use iTunes if you have a macOS Mojave or earlier version or if you are using Windows. Connect your iPhone to the computer using the lightning cable and put it in Recovery Mode.

- **For iPhone X or Later Models:** Press and release the “Volume Up” button, followed by the “Volume Down" button. Hold the “Side” button until the Recovery Mode screen appears.
