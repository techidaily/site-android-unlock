### 1: Lock Types

Before we move towards the **Vivo X100  pattern unlock**, let's talk about its lock types and security system. Vivo X100  is one of the older versions of Vivo  android phones that was released in 2016.

### 2: How to Set Them up?

Follow these steps to set up any type of lock on your Vivo X100  .

- Open “Settings” on your mobile and select "Lockscreen and Password".

- Select the "Lockscreen Password" option at the top and tap on the "Enable Lock Screen" button.
- Select the type of lock you want to set and create a password.

### 3: How to Remove Them with Password or Pattern?
