### Method 2: Entering Into Safe Mode

Safe Mode is a diagnostic mode in Android that can help bypass third-party lock screen apps. It’s useful if you’ve used a third-party app for your lock screen.

To do this, press the power button, then long-press on the **Power off** option. Tap **OK** when **Reboot to safe mode** option appears. In Safe Mode, third-party apps are disabled. Thus, you can now access your device if a third-party app is causing lock issues.

### Method 3: Force Resetting a Device/Flashing a New ROM

Force resetting or flashing a new ROM can be considered a last resort. They involve erasing all data on your device or installing a new operating system.

- **Force resetting your device**. To force reset your Vivo, press and hold the Power and Volume Down buttons simultaneously to enter recovery mode. Use the volume buttons to navigate to **Wipe data/factory reset**and select it with the power button. This will get rid of existing password locks.
- **Flashing a new ROM**. This is more complex and typically requires downloading a new firmware and flashing tool. It’s only recommended for advanced users or as a last resort.

Remember, while these methods can effectively unlock your device, they also come with risks. Always [<u>back up your data regularly</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/backup/android-backup-software.html), and use these methods responsibly, considering their potential to erase your data or affect your device’s warranty.

## Bonus: How To Perform a SIM Unlock on Vivo

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Understanding the Prerequisites

Before proceeding with the SIM unlock, ensure you’re in good standing with your carrier. This means:

- No outstanding bills.
- Your contract for the phone has expired.
- The device has been in your possession for at least 60-90 days.

Different carriers have varying requirements for a SIM unlock, so your first move should be to contact them for specific details.

### Steps for SIM Unlock Through Your Carrier

Here are the steps to SIM **unlock your Vivo Y02T**,These generally involve the following steps but are still subject to the official instructions of your carrier:

![sim and unlock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/%20google-pixel-7-unlock-10.jpg)

- **Step 1:** Open the Phone app and dial \*#06# on your Vivo. This will display your phone’s IMEI number. Note this number down for future reference.
- **Step 2:** Call your carrier and request a SIM unlock code. You’ll likely need to provide your Vivo’s IMEI number.
- **Step 3:** If you meet your carrier’s requirements, they will email you the SIM unlock code within 2-5 days.
- **Step 4:** Once you receive the code, replace your current SIM with one from a different carrier. When prompted, enter the SIM unlock code you received via email.

### Alternative Method: Android SIM Unlock

If your carrier cannot unlock your Vivo Y02T  ’s SIM, or if you prefer a quicker solution, consider using network unlocking services. This may be websites like UnlockBase, Mobile Unlocks, etc.

This generally involves the following steps:

- **Step 1**: Like the previous method, retrieve your IMEI number by dialing \*#06# on your Pixel.
- **Step 2:** Go to the Android SIM unlock provider’s website and enter your device’s IMEI number.
- **Step 3:** Follow through with the checkout process, providing payment and contact information.
- **Step 4:** Once the payment is processed, you’ll receive the unlock code via SMS or email. Insert a SIM from a different carrier into your Pixel, then enter the received [<u>unlock code</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/samsung-unlock-codes.html) when prompted.

By following these steps, you can successfully unlock the SIM of your Vivo device, ensuring you can enjoy your phone with the carrier of your choice, wherever your travels may take you.

### Important Considerations

Remember, unlocking the SIM doesn’t absolve you from your carrier contract. You’re still obligated to make timely payments as per your agreement. The primary advantage of unlocking your SIM is the freedom to use your Vivo Y02T with any carrier’s SIM card, offering greater flexibility and control over your mobile experience. Thus, it is encouraged not to do anything illegal to avoid future complications.
