## Part 2: 4 Simple Ways to Bypass Your HTC U23 Phone Password

### 1\. Google Find My Device

Our first approach to unlocking your device is to do a factory reset. That erases every one of the data on your phone too. You can perform this method if you have your Google account credentials and are ready. However, we want you to back up your data so you can sign once more after the reset and restore a ton of your data.

Since you're locked out, you will have to utilize a technique to do the reset. The most straightforward way is to utilize Google's Find My Device site. So, if the Find my Device option feature is enabled on your phone, you can tap the **Erase device** choice on this page to reset it.

![google find my device](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/what-is-my-phone-password-3.jpg)

### 2\. Enter Recovery Mode to Hard Reset

If you can't use the Find my device feature, you'll have to factory reset physically. To do as such:

- Power your device off.
- Hold the Volume (-) and power keys all the while after the screen goes dark to raise Android's bootloader menu. This button blend might be different relying on your device model.
- Press the Volume down button two times to feature the Recovery Mode choice. Then, at that point, press the power button to choose it.
- Hold the power button and press the Volume up button to enter this mode.
- Utilize the volume buttons to go to the Wipe data/Factory Reset choice. Continue with the steps to play out a factory reset.

### 3\. Use ADB

This fix isn't guaranteed to work; if you don't watch out, it could damage your phone. Therefore, we suggest you back up everything on your Android before proceeding.

If your phone has USB debugging enabled, is connected to a PC, and is not encrypted, follow these steps:

- Connect your device to your PC through a USB connector.
- Open Command Prompt or Terminal window to your ADB installation registry.
- Type in adb shell rm/data/system/gesture.key and click the Enter key.
- Reboot your phone. When you do, the solid lock screen ought to be gone.
- That is not a permanent condition, so reset your PIN or password lock before you reboot your device once more. That's how you reset **password for phone.**

### 4.Dr.Fone-Screen Unlock

If you want to unlock your phone without losing any data, we suggest Dr.Fone-Screen Unlock. Dr.Fone is a professional unlocking tool that can remove all types of screen locks in minutes.

**Step 6.** ADB terminal will pop out. Now, the first is to type in ADB _devices_. This is to check if your device is recognized by ADB. If there is no device listed below, try to remove and reconnect your HTC U23 and retype the command. If there are listed devices already, proceed.

![Minimal adb and fastboot command window adb devices command](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/06/14648317691463.jpg)

- _cd /data/data/com.android.providers.settings/databases_
- _sqlite3 settings.db_

This would work if you have your USB debugging turned on before it was locked. That's how to unlock Android using ADB.

## Part 4: How to Unlock Phone via Find My Device (with Data Loss)

Google Find My Device is another handy way to unlock your locked Android device. However, it requires you to have your Google ID credentials and you have previously enabled Find My Device features. Moreover, it will erase all the data on your device. Use the following steps to unlock your Android phone via Find My Device:

**Step 1:** Open a web browser on a computer or another device and visit the Find My Device website. Now, sign in with the Google account that is linked to the locked Android device.

**Step 2:** After signing in, you will see a list of devices associated with your Google account on the left side of the screen. Select the locked Android device from the list and choose the "Erase Device" option from the menu on the left-hand side.

![tap on erase device option](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/09/unlock-android-phone-1.jpg)

**Step 3:** You will now be asked to confirm your identity through a Google account password or using a pass-key. Afterward, follow the on-screen instructions to erase and unlock your Android device.

## Part 5: How to Unlock Android Phone without Losing Data in Safe Mode

This method works only if the screen lock you have been using is a third-party app. Since Safe Mode disables third-party apps, you can easily use it to uninstall the problematic app. Here is **how to unlock an Android phone without losing data**:

**Step 1:** On your Android device, press and hold “Power” and “Volume Down” keys together for 3 seconds. After the Power menu becomes visible, press and hold the “Power off” option.
