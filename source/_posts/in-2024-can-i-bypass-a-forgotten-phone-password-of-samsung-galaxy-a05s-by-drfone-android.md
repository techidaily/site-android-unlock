## Part 2: 4 Simple Ways to Bypass Your Samsung Galaxy A05s Phone Password

### 1\. Google Find My Device

Our first approach to unlocking your device is to do a factory reset. That erases every one of the data on your phone too. You can perform this method if you have your Google account credentials and are ready. However, we want you to back up your data so you can sign once more after the reset and restore a ton of your data.

Since you're locked out, you will have to utilize a technique to do the reset. The most straightforward way is to utilize Google's Find My Device site. So, if the Find my Device option feature is enabled on your phone, you can tap the **Erase device** choice on this page to reset it.

### 2\. Enter Recovery Mode to Hard Reset

If you can't use the Find my device feature, you'll have to factory reset physically. To do as such:

- Power your device off.
- Hold the Volume (-) and power keys all the while after the screen goes dark to raise Android's bootloader menu. This button blend might be different relying on your device model.
- Press the Volume down button two times to feature the Recovery Mode choice. Then, at that point, press the power button to choose it.
