## Part 2: 4 Simple Ways to Bypass Your Samsung Galaxy XCover 6 Pro Tactical Edition Phone Password

### 1\. Google Find My Device

Our first approach to unlocking your device is to do a factory reset. That erases every one of the data on your phone too. You can perform this method if you have your Google account credentials and are ready. However, we want you to back up your data so you can sign once more after the reset and restore a ton of your data.

Since you're locked out, you will have to utilize a technique to do the reset. The most straightforward way is to utilize Google's Find My Device site. So, if the Find my Device option feature is enabled on your phone, you can tap the **Erase device** choice on this page to reset it.

## Part 1: Ways That Samsung Lets You Unlock Your Samsung Galaxy XCover 6 Pro Tactical Edition

Samsung Galaxy XCover 6 Pro Tactical Edition  are more than just smartphones; they are gateways to a personalized and secure user experience. To access the myriad of features these devices offer, Google provides several unlocking methods, ensuring both convenience and security. Here are these options:

- **Face Unlock.Pixel’s Face Unlock** uses advanced facial recognition software. It scans your face to grant access, offering a hands-free and quick way to unlock your Pixel. This feature can be activated in the security settings and requires a simple glance at your phone to unlock.

_**Tips:** Is your Pixel locked accidently? Are you searching for a powerful tool? No worries as [Dr.Fone](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare-dr-fone-unlock-android-screen/) is here to help you. Download it and start a seamless unlock experience!_

### Method 2: Entering Into Safe Mode

Safe Mode is a diagnostic mode in Android that can help bypass third-party lock screen apps. It’s useful if you’ve used a third-party app for your lock screen.

To do this, press the power button, then long-press on the **Power off** option. Tap **OK** when **Reboot to safe mode** option appears. In Safe Mode, third-party apps are disabled. Thus, you can now access your device if a third-party app is causing lock issues.

### Method 3: Force Resetting a Device/Flashing a New ROM

Force resetting or flashing a new ROM can be considered a last resort. They involve erasing all data on your device or installing a new operating system.

- **Force resetting your device**. To force reset your Samsung, press and hold the Power and Volume Down buttons simultaneously to enter recovery mode. Use the volume buttons to navigate to **Wipe data/factory reset**and select it with the power button. This will get rid of existing password locks.
- **Flashing a new ROM**. This is more complex and typically requires downloading a new firmware and flashing tool. It’s only recommended for advanced users or as a last resort.

Remember, while these methods can effectively unlock your device, they also come with risks. Always [<u>back up your data regularly</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/backup/android-backup-software.html), and use these methods responsibly, considering their potential to erase your data or affect your device’s warranty.

### Alternative Method: Android SIM Unlock

If your carrier cannot unlock your Samsung Galaxy XCover 6 Pro Tactical Edition  ’s SIM, or if you prefer a quicker solution, consider using network unlocking services. This may be websites like UnlockBase, Mobile Unlocks, etc.

This generally involves the following steps:

- **Step 1**: Like the previous method, retrieve your IMEI number by dialing \*#06# on your Pixel.
- **Step 2:** Go to the Android SIM unlock provider’s website and enter your device’s IMEI number.
- **Step 3:** Follow through with the checkout process, providing payment and contact information.
- **Step 4:** Once the payment is processed, you’ll receive the unlock code via SMS or email. Insert a SIM from a different carrier into your Pixel, then enter the received [<u>unlock code</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/samsung-unlock-codes.html) when prompted.

By following these steps, you can successfully unlock the SIM of your Samsung device, ensuring you can enjoy your phone with the carrier of your choice, wherever your travels may take you.

### Important Considerations

Remember, unlocking the SIM doesn’t absolve you from your carrier contract. You’re still obligated to make timely payments as per your agreement. The primary advantage of unlocking your SIM is the freedom to use your Samsung Galaxy XCover 6 Pro Tactical Edition with any carrier’s SIM card, offering greater flexibility and control over your mobile experience. Thus, it is encouraged not to do anything illegal to avoid future complications.
