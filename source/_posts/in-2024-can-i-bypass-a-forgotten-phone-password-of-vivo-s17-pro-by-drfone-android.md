### 1\. Google Find My Device

Our first approach to unlocking your device is to do a factory reset. That erases every one of the data on your phone too. You can perform this method if you have your Google account credentials and are ready. However, we want you to back up your data so you can sign once more after the reset and restore a ton of your data.

Since you're locked out, you will have to utilize a technique to do the reset. The most straightforward way is to utilize Google's Find My Device site. So, if the Find my Device option feature is enabled on your phone, you can tap the **Erase device** choice on this page to reset it.

![google find my device](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/what-is-my-phone-password-3.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 2\. Enter Recovery Mode to Hard Reset

If you can't use the Find my device feature, you'll have to factory reset physically. To do as such:

- Power your device off.
- Hold the Volume (-) and power keys all the while after the screen goes dark to raise Android's bootloader menu. This button blend might be different relying on your device model.
- Press the Volume down button two times to feature the Recovery Mode choice. Then, at that point, press the power button to choose it.
- Hold the power button and press the Volume up button to enter this mode.
- Utilize the volume buttons to go to the Wipe data/Factory Reset choice. Continue with the steps to play out a factory reset.

![wipe data](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/what-is-my-phone-password-4.jpg)

### 3\. Use ADB

This fix isn't guaranteed to work; if you don't watch out, it could damage your phone. Therefore, we suggest you back up everything on your Android before proceeding.

If your phone has USB debugging enabled, is connected to a PC, and is not encrypted, follow these steps:

- Connect your device to your PC through a USB connector.
- Open Command Prompt or Terminal window to your ADB installation registry.
- Type in adb shell rm/data/system/gesture.key and click the Enter key.
- Reboot your phone. When you do, the solid lock screen ought to be gone.
- That is not a permanent condition, so reset your PIN or password lock before you reboot your device once more. That's how you reset **password for phone.**

### 1.Slide

This is the most common method of unlocking an android lock screen. On all most all the android device, you'll notice a lock mostly on the right side (sometimes on top) of a round charm. You just have to direct towards the lock and then the lock screen will be unlocked in no time. This method doesn't provide any security (it just protects your device from sudden access by tapping on screen or any of the button) to your device as no password or PIN is required to set the "Slide" unlock.

![android lock screen settings](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/android-lock-screen-settings-3.jpg)

Keep your any finger on the middle of the round charm and by keeping your finger pressed, reach on the lock icon. The lock screen will be unlocked just after reaching your finger to the lock icon.

### 2.Face Unlock

This method of unlocking your lock screen needs your Android device to snap a photo of your with its camera. After you set the snapped photo as the unlocking recognition, you could unlock your device through showing your face on the screen.

Capture a picture of your face with your Android device's camera and then set it for logging in into your device. From the lock screen, by just by holding your face, you can log in. It's very interesting, but you should never rely on this method for strong security as this method of unlocking is prone to break easily as an intruder can unlock your device by putting a photo of you in front of your device. Moreover, this method sometimes doesn't work properly. So it's better to go for some other highly secured options for locking your screen.

### 3.Pattern

This is a way of setting pattern for lock screen from a grid of nine dots. You can select the pattern like some letter like Z, L or C etc, but nothing guarantees high security as the set pattern can be easily guessed or be seen while you are unlocking your device. Another problem is that by unlocking with the same pattern, your finger leaves some marks for the pattern's path. By following the path, a stranger can unlock your device. So for little security, you can use pattern unlock method on your Android device.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![android lock screen settings](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/android-lock-screen-settings-5.jpg)

Go to the lock screen setting for Pattern and then set the pattern by sliding your finger from one dot to another, then another and like that way. Remember which pattern you've set in order to unlock your device in the next time.

### 4.PIN

You might be troubled by thinking about the difference between PIN and Password. A little distinction is there for a PIN and that is it consists of numbers only whereas for password, you can associate some alphabetical letters or signs along with numbers.

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://bluettide.pxf.io/c/5597632/2042332/17092" target="_top" id="2042332"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17092-2042332" border="0" alt="BLUETTI NEW LAUNCH AC180T" width="960" height="900"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2042332/17092" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![android lock screen settings](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/android-lock-screen-settings-6.jpg)

Go to the lock screen setting for PIN and then set a PIN that consists of minimum 4 digits. It's your choice to use 4 or more digit PIN. After setting the PIN, you can access your Android device by putting the PIN in a box from the lock screen. PIN protected lock screen is highly protected if the PIN is set strongly.

### 5.Password

In addition to PIN protection, you can consider it as password by adding some letters, special characters with the previously selected PIN codes. It's also very much highly protected method of locking screen though you might be bored with tapping for the password again and again. But never ignore the value of your device's files, so a password can be a well-sought lock screen protection for many users.
