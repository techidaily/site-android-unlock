## Method 1. Google Find My Device (Without Password/Pin/Pattern)

If you're like me, you've probably tried a million different ways to unlock your Motorola phone, only to be frustrated by the results. Luckily, there's an easy way to unlock your Motorola phone using Google's Find My Device feature.

Google will use your location, phone information, and connection log to find your Nokia.

- **Step 2**: Sign in with your Google account, which you used on your locked Motorola phone.
- **Step 3**: The Android Device Manager dashboard will show your locked Motorola with three options: Ring, Lock, and Erase.
- **Step 4**: Simply click on "Lock".
- **Step 5**: Enter a password that is not your Google account password in the "New Password" field.
- **Step 6**: Type the new password in the "Confirm password" field. This password lock will replace the current lock screen.
- **Step 7**: You can leave the "Recovery message" field empty or type anything in it.
- **Step 8**: Enter another phone number in the "Phone number" field, although this is optional.
- **Step 9**: Choose "Lock" after entering your password and filling out the optional fields if you wish.
- **Step 10**: If the process is successful, you will receive the unlock code within a few seconds.
- **Step 11**: Navigate to the "Screen Settings" menu after unlocking your device.
- **Step 12**: Use a new password; you can use the temporary password if you want.

You can use it to unlock your Motorola if you have activated the Android Device Manager or Google Find My Device before your phone was locked.

### A few conditions, however, must be met for this to work

- You must turn on your Motorola phone.
- Before locking your phone, you must activate Google Find My Device or Android Device Manager.
- You must have your Motorola GPS turned on to use it.
- You must be connected to WiFi on your device to log into your Google account.
