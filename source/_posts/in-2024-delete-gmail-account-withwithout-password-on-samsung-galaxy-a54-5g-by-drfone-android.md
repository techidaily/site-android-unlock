## Part 1: How To Track Your Samsung Galaxy A54 5G on Google Earth

This **Google Maps IMEI number tracking** issue has caused quite a buzz and controversy on the internet. It has raised many concerns regarding the safety and privacy of every smartphone user. To tell you the truth, Google Earth lacks IMEI location data and does not provide such capabilities. Thus, there is no truth in **tracking IMEI numbers through Google Earth**.

However, if you have access to a cell phone's GPS coordinates or the location of a cell tower to which it is linked, you can use Google Earth to follow its location.

### How To Locate a Smartphone Using Google Earth

Many current smartphones include GPS receivers that allow them to pinpoint their exact location. If you know the phone's GPS coordinates, you can plug them into Google Earth to see where it is on the map.

- **Step 1:** This process won't be possible if your location services are not enabled on your phone. To do this, navigate to **Settings,** then **Location** on Android, and **Settings** > **Privacy** > **Location Services** on iOS.

![iphone location services](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/09/track-imei-number-through-google-earth-02.jpg)

- **Step 2:** Google Earth can be downloaded and installed on your computer or mobile device. It works with Windows, macOS, Android, and iOS. Download it from your device's **Google Earth** website or the app store.

![install google earth android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/09/track-imei-number-through-google-earth-03.jpg)

## Part 5: How to Unlock Android Pattern Lock in Safe Mode?

This is a simple and effective solution to knowing how to unlock patterns on an Android device. Nevertheless, this solution will only work for third-party lock screen apps. If you are using your phone’s native lock feature, then it might not work. After restarting your phone in Safe Mode, you can easily move past its pattern lock without any trouble. All you need to do is follow these steps:

- **Step 1.** Simply press the Power button on your device to get the Power menu on its screen.
- **Step 2.** Now, tap and hold the “Power off” option.

![power off android phone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/09/15057373454386.jpg)

- **Step 3.** This will display the following pop-up message. Agree to it and restart your phone in Safe Mode.
- **Step 4.** Once the Samsung Galaxy A54 5G device would be restarted in Safe Mode, the third-party lock screen would be disabled automatically.

![android safe mode](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/09/15057373753769.jpg)

- **Step 5.** Later, you can go to the Samsung Galaxy A54 5G device’s Settings > Apps and remove the third-party app as well. In this way, you would be able to learn how to unlock pattern lock for any other app.

## Part 6: How to Unlock Pattern Lock with the Factory Reset?

Consider this as your last resort, as it will wipe the data and saved settings on your device entirely. As the name suggests, your device would be restored to its factory setting by losing its data. Though, if you wish to learn how to unlock a pattern by performing a factory reset, then you can perform these steps:

- **Step 1.** To start with, enter the Recovery Mode on your device. This can be done by pressing the Home, Power, and Volume Up key at the same time.
- **Step 2.** Though, the correct key combination might differ from one version of the Android device to another.
- **Step 3.** Use the Volume Up and Down key to navigate and the Power/Home button to make a choice.

![boot in recovery mode](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/09/15057373935558.jpg)

- **Step 4.** Select the wipe data/factory reset option to perform pattern unlock.
- **Step 5.** Confirm your choice to factory reset your device.

![factory reset device](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/09/15057374154915.jpg)
