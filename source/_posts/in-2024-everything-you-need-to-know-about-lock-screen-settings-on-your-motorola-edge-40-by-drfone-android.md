### 1.Slide

This is the most common method of unlocking an android lock screen. On all most all the android device, you'll notice a lock mostly on the right side (sometimes on top) of a round charm. You just have to direct towards the lock and then the lock screen will be unlocked in no time.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 2.Face Unlock

This method of unlocking your lock screen needs your Android device to snap a photo of your with its camera. After you set the snapped photo as the unlocking recognition, you could unlock your device through showing your face on the screen.

Capture a picture of your face with your Android device's camera and then set it for logging in into your device. From the lock screen, by just by holding your face, you can log in. It's very interesting, but you should never rely on this method for strong security as this method of unlocking is prone to break easily as an intruder can unlock your device by putting a photo of you in front of your device. Moreover, this method sometimes doesn't work properly. So it's better to go for some other highly secured options for locking your screen.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 3.Pattern

This is a way of setting pattern for lock screen from a grid of nine dots. You can select the pattern like some letter like Z, L or C etc, but nothing guarantees high security as the set pattern can be easily guessed or be seen while you are unlocking your device. Another problem is that by unlocking with the same pattern, your finger leaves some marks for the pattern's path. By following the path, a stranger can unlock your device. So for little security, you can use pattern unlock method on your Android device.

![android lock screen settings](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/android-lock-screen-settings-5.jpg)

Go to the lock screen setting for Pattern and then set the pattern by sliding your finger from one dot to another, then another and like that way. Remember which pattern you've set in order to unlock your device in the next time.

### 4.PIN

You might be troubled by thinking about the difference between PIN and Password. A little distinction is there for a PIN and that is it consists of numbers only whereas for password, you can associate some alphabetical letters or signs along with numbers.

![android lock screen settings](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/android-lock-screen-settings-6.jpg)

Go to the lock screen setting for PIN and then set a PIN that consists of minimum 4 digits. It's your choice to use 4 or more digit PIN. After setting the PIN, you can access your Android device by putting the PIN in a box from the lock screen. PIN protected lock screen is highly protected if the PIN is set strongly.

### 5.Password

In addition to PIN protection, you can consider it as password by adding some letters, special characters with the previously selected PIN codes. It's also very much highly protected method of locking screen though you might be bored with tapping for the password again and again. But never ignore the value of your device's files, so a password can be a well-sought lock screen protection for many users.

## Unlocking the Power of Smart Lock: A Beginner's Guide for Motorola Edge 40 Users

Google constantly comes up with features to simplify the way users interact and complete tasks on the Android platform. One of the most important features that techies loved to debate about was the Smart Lock Android, a secure password manager functioning in sync with a Google account on the Android phone.

Android Lollipop added a feature called Smart Lock, and the feature was devised as a smart tool to prevent the Android phone from locking once it was initially unlocked. In other words, the feature overrides an Android phone's Lock Screen feature, thereby saving users the need to enter passwords every time the Motorola Edge 40 device locks.

If you're at home, it's likely your android phone is locked out if you haven't accessed at for some time. Smart Locks solves the problem in many ways. It allows you to allocate trusted places. Once you within range of the trusted places, your phone won't lock. Trusted devices come next. Smart Lock is assigned to Bluetooth and Android NFC unlock devices.

## Top Apps and Online Tools To Track Motorola Edge 40 Phone [With/Without IMEI Number]

Losing your smartphone can be distressing, given its importance in daily life. Ensuring the ability to trace the whereabouts of a misplaced device holds great importance. It is due to potential theft, loss, or accidental misplacement.

Fortunately, many ways exist to retrieve a lost mobile phone by utilizing its IMEI number. This article will take you through the **anti-theft app & IMEI tracker of all phone location** methods. Additionally, we will discuss a unique tool designed to unlock locked devices.

## Part 1: An Introduction to IMEI Numbers and Its Utility

Every mobile device has a special identifier that is helpful in the **anti-theft app & IMEI tracker** activities. It is known as the International Mobile Equipment Identity or IMEI number. While often overlooked, it holds the key to many essential services and functions.

This makes it an indispensable component of modern mobile technology. The IMEI number serves as a digital fingerprint for mobile phones. Its primary purposes are summarized below:

1. **Device Identification:** Each mobile device possesses a distinct IMEI number. This sets it apart from every other phone in existence. This identification is essential for cellular networks and service providers. It helps in recognizing, managing, and connecting devices accurately.
2. **Traceability and Tracking:** In cases of theft, loss, or unauthorized use, the IMEI number becomes a crucial tool for tracking. It provides law enforcement agencies with the means to pinpoint the Motorola Edge 40 device's location.
3. **Warranty and Support:** Manufacturers use IMEI numbers to manage warranties and provide technical support. These numbers help confirm the Motorola Edge 40 device's authenticity, purchase date, and warranty coverage. This streamlines the process of repairs and replacements.
4. **Security Measures:** IMEI numbers play a role in security measures such as device blacklisting. If a device is reported stolen, its IMEI number can be added to a global database. This prevents it from being used on any network and renders it useless to thieves.
