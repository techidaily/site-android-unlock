## Forgot Pattern Lock? Here's How You Can Unlock Huawei Nova Y71 Pattern Lock Screen

Forgetting the pattern lock of a device and getting locked out of it is probably one of the most frustrating scenarios faced by Android users. Nevertheless, unlike popular operating systems, Android provides a seamless way to past the forgot pattern lock feature.

You can either try Google’s native solution or a third-party tool in case you have forgotten the pattern lock on your device and reset it. In no time, you will be able to access your device (or even someone else’s phone by following these techniques). To make things easier for you, we have provided three simple solutions to resolve forgotten patterns on Android devices.

## Part 1: How to bypass forgot pattern lock using the 'Forgot Pattern' feature?

One of the easiest and fastest ways to fix the forgot pattern lock issue on a device is by using its inbuilt “Forgot Pattern” feature. If you are using an Android 4.4 or earlier version, then you can simply access this feature. Since users can hack an Android device just by knowing the Google credentials of the connected device, the solution was later discontinued (as it was considered a security vulnerability). Nevertheless, if your device hasn’t been updated and you are using an Android 4.4 or previous version, then you can bypass the forgot pattern lock by following these steps:

**Step 1.** Firstly, provide the wrong pattern to your device. It will let you know that you applied the incorrect pattern.

**Step 2.** On the same prompt, you can see an option of “Forgot pattern” on the bottom. Simply tap on it.

![forgot pattern](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/09/15059289368742.jpg)

**Step 3.** This will open a new screen, which can be used to bypass the forgotten pattern of Android. Select the option for entering the Google Account details and proceed.

**Step 4.** To reset the forgot pattern lock, you need to provide the correct Google credentials of the account already linked to the Huawei Nova Y71 device.

![enter google account](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/09/15059290192675.jpg)

**Step 5.** After signing in to the interface, you will be asked to provide a new pattern lock for the Huawei Nova Y71 device.

![draw an unlock pattern](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/09/15059290477717.jpg)

**Step 6.** Confirm your choice and set a new pattern lock on your device.

## Part 2: How to get past forgot pattern lock using Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (Android)?

One of the major drawbacks of the “Forgot pattern” feature is that it doesn’t work on new Android devices. Since most of the Huawei Nova Y71 devices out there have been updated, the technique has been outdated. Therefore, you can simply take the assistance of [Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (Android)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare-dr-fone-unlock-android-screen/) to bypass the forgot pattern lock on your device. Without causing any harm to your device or erasing its data, your device’s password or pattern would be removed.

It is a part of the Dr.Fone toolkit and is compatible with all the leading Android devices out there. It can be used to remove passwords, patterns, pins, and more. It has an easy-to-use interface and provides a simple click-through process to resolve the forgot pattern Android lock on your device. However, this tool merely retains all the data after unlocking Samsung and LG screens. Other Android locked screens can also be unlocked, and the only thing is that it will wipe all the data after unlocking.

## Solution 4: Unlock the Huawei Phone Using Custom Recovery (SD card needed)

TWRP: <https://twrp.me/>

Also, since you can't move anything to your device when it is locked, you need to do the same using its SD card. After ensuring that you have met all the basic prerequisites, follow these steps and learn how to unlock the Huawei phone's forgotten password using a custom recovery.

- **Step 1.** Download a [Pattern Password Disable](http://forum.xda-developers.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=2532214&d=1390399283) application and save its ZIP file on your computer. Now, insert your SD card into your system and move the recently downloaded file to it.

- **Step 2.** Reboot your phone into recovery mode. For instance, the TWRP recovery mode can be turned on by simultaneously pressing the Power, Home, and Volume Up button. You would get different options on your screen after entering the custom recovery mode. Tap on “Install” and browse the Pattern Password Disable application file.

![unlock lg forgot password - team win recovery project](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/03/14892204165153.jpg)

- **Step 3.** Install the above-mentioned application and wait for a few minutes. Afterward, restart your Huawei phone. Ideally, your phone will be restarted without any lock screen. If you get a lock screen, you can bypass it by entering any random digits.
