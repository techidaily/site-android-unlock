## Method 3: Factory Reset Huawei Nova Y71  Phones (Wipes User Data)

There is a standard factory reset built into every Huawei Nova Y71  phone to allow users to erase the Huawei Nova Y71 device and start over fully.

## How to Remove a Previously Synced Google Account from Your Huawei Nova Y71

The setting up process of a new Android phone requires you to add a Google account that saves all activities and data of the phone like search history, details of online shipping, play store purchases, and more. Once the account is set, it cannot be changed till you delete everything from your phone. Moreover, with the introduction of FRP lock, even a factory reset will not remove the synced Google account.
