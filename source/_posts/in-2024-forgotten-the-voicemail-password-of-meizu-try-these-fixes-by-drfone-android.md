![select erase data](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/05/select-erase-device.jpg)

### Using Google Account Details

Almost all Android smartphones, including Meizu 21 Pro , require you to enter your Google account details when setting up your phone for the first time. This account comes in handy later on in situations where your phone is lost or stolen or if you’re switching to another phone. However, it can also help with basic issues like unlocking your phone in case you forget your Meizu 21 Pro  screen unlock PIN, pattern, or password. But to use this method successfully, you need to remember the email address bound to the Meizu 21 Pro device and its password.

Here's how to unlock the Meizu 21 Pro  pattern lock without losing data using your Google account:

- **Step 1:** Enter the incorrect PIN, pattern, or password 5 times, and click on “Forgot Password” or “Forgot Pattern.”

If you don't remember your Google account details, you can still unlock your Meizu 21 Pro  phone using a third-party tool.

- **Step 2:** Now select the “Answer Security Question” option and type in the answer.

## How to Unlock Meizu 21 Pro  by Hard Reset?

Hard resetting your smartphone usually solves everything! Hence, it can also help you unlock your Meizu 21 Pro  phone; however, using this method will erase all the data on your phone. So, if you still want to unlock Meizu 21 Pro  phone using this method, only do so if you have backed up your device and have no other way to unlock your phone. This includes forgetting your Google account details or not having access to a PC to download and use Dr Fone - Screen Unlock (Android).

**Step 2:** Carefully check the information provided on the screen. If there is "X" before the "Network" option and the number in front of it is larger than 0, it means your device can be unlocked. If the number in front of "Network" is 0, your device can't be unlocked as it is hard-locked.

![check the network status](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/10/unlock-sony-xperia-pin-code-6.jpg)

**Step 3:** The next step involves getting your device’s IMEI number. To accomplish this task, simply input "\*#06#" on your device.
