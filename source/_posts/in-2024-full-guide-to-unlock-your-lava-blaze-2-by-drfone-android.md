### 4\. Dirty Phone or Sensor

#### Solution

##### 1\. Cleaning the Phone

Employ a gentle, dry microfiber cloth for wiping down the complete surface of your Pixel device. Take particular care to thoroughly clean the region surrounding the fingerprint sensor. Refrain from utilizing rough substances or strong chemicals as they could potentially cause harm to the Lava Blaze 2 device.

##### 3\. Compressed Air or Soft Brush

### 6\. Clean Your Finger

#### Problem

The problem may lie with your fingers rather than the Lava Blaze 2 device. Unclean or moist fingers can hinder accurate fingerprint recognition on the sensor, causing **the Lava Blaze 2 fingerprint sensor to not work**.

#### Solution

##### 1\. Cleanse and Dry Your Hands

Remove any dirt, oil, or moisture that might cause issues with the fingerprint sensor. It's crucial to wash and thoroughly dry your hands. Additionally, verify that your fingers are entirely dry before engaging the sensor. The reason is any moisture or dampness may cause inaccuracies in fingerprint identification.

##### 2\. Avoid Oily or Greasy Substances
