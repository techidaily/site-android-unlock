- **Step 2.** Then you would need to insert the SD card into your locked phone and then restart the Samsung Galaxy M14 5G device in recovery mode.
- **Step 3.** Next, move on to flash on the zip files to the card and restart. After that, your phone will boot and open up without the locked screen.

_**Note**: Sometimes, the Samsung Galaxy M14 5G device may ask for a pattern or password. You just need to put in any random pattern/password then it will get unlocked._
