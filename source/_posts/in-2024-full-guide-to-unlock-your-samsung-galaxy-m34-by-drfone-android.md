Depending on your carrier, the default voicemail password is either the last seven or final four digits of your phone number. Your voicemails should be accessible if you dial the number without the area code. In this way, you can quickly get your default voicemail password.

### 2\. Can I Remove My Voicemail Password?

From your mobile device, dial 123 to see the password for your voicemail. To enable (add) or disable (delete) your voicemail password, choose option 4. To enable or disable the screen password, select option 1. If your password has been deactivated, dialing 123 will not ask you to enter one.

### 3\. How Can I Receive Voicemail Messages From Another Device?

You may access your mailbox on another phone if your phone is out of reach or the battery is dead. Make a call to your phone number from a different one. Tap the pound key (#) on the phone's dial pad after the prerecorded "Please leave a message" greeting has begun to play. Enter the pin from your voicemail to start receiving messages from another device.
