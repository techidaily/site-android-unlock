After removing the Samsung Galaxy S24 device from Knox Enrollment via the admin account, you may still need to uninstall the Knox app from the Android device. This can usually be done through the Samsung Galaxy S24 device’s settings. Navigate to ‘Apps’ in the settings menu, locate the Knox app, and select ‘Uninstall’ or ‘Disable’. Be aware that this option might not be available on all devices, depending on how Knox was configured.

### Rooting and Flashing a New ROM To Remove Knox Enrollment Service

For the more tech-savvy users, another method to **bypass Knox Enrollment Service** is by rooting the Samsung Galaxy S24 device and flashing a new ROM. This process involves gaining root access to the Samsung Galaxy S24 device’s operating system, which allows you to modify the software extensively.
