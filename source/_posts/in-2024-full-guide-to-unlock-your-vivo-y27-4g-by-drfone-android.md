This option wipes all user data and resets the phone to how you received it in the box.

**Step 3:** Tap Erase Everything.

## Method 4: Use Google Find My Device To Unlock Vivo Y27 4G  Phones (Wipes User Data)

Using Find My Device, you can play a sound on the Vivo Y27 4G device to locate it in the house if you have misplaced it, lock the phone in case it is lost, and wipe the Vivo Y27 4G device remotely.

**Step 1:** Go to <https://accounts.google.com>.

**Step 2:** Log in and go to Security > Your Devices:

![unlock motorola phone with google](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/09/full-guide-to-unlock-motorola-phones-10.jpg)
