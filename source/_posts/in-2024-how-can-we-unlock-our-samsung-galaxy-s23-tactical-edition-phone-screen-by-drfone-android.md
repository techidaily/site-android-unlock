**Step 3. Select unlock mode**

If you click “Remove without Data Loss,” only some limited Samsung or LG phone models can be unlocked without losing data. To unlock most phone brands' screens, “100% Remove Screen Lock” is a better choice.

**Step 2.** You must give your Google ID credentials to sign in. Remember that this should be a similar Google account connected to your phone.

**Step 3.** After logging in, select your device.

**Step 4.** You will get three choices here, i.e., lock, erase, and ring.

![find my device](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/tips-for-pattern-lock-1.jpg)

**Step 5.** Click on the "Lock" button to reset its pattern.

**Step 6.** It will open another spring-up window. From here, you can give the new password to your phone.

**Step 7.** After affirming your PIN/password, you can give a recovery message and number (in case of theft only).

**Step 8.** Complete the process and sign out of your account on the browser.

### 2\. Forgot Pattern (For Android 4.4 or earlier)

**Step 1.** First and foremost, give some wrong patterns to your phone. It will tell you that you attempted the incorrect **pattern lock**.

**Step 2.** On a similar window, click the "Forgot pattern" choice on the base.

**Step 3.** That will open another screen, which you can use to sidestep the forgotten pattern of Android. Select the choice for entering the Google Account credentials and continue.

![google account](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/tips-for-pattern-lock-2.jpg)

**Step 4.** To reset the **lock screen pattern**, you must give the correct details of the Google ID previously logged into the Samsung Galaxy S23 Tactical Edition device.

![reboot to safe mode](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/tips-for-pattern-lock-4.jpg)

**Step 2:** Clear your lock screen application's data.

Clean data off your lock screen app, uninstall it, and then reboot your device to escape safe mode. When you do so, your phone or Android device will unlock.

### 5\. Use ADB (USB required for Android 10 and lower)

- Connect your device to your PC using a USB connector.
- On your PC, open a terminal window (or command prompt).
- Type in the commands given below. Press Enter after each line:

adb shell

album/data/data/com.android.providers.settings/databases

sqlite3 settings.db

update system set value=0 where name='lock\_pattern\_autolock';

update system set value=0 where name='lockscreen.lockedoutpermanently';

.quit

exit

adb reboot

- After your gadget has rebooted, enter the command below:

adb shell

rm/data/framework/gesture.key

exit

adb reboot

- Your phone will reboot. After it reboots and requests a security pattern, you can utilize any pattern, and it will unlock.
