## Part 3: Common Problems of Disabling Lock Screen

The process to disable the screen lock on Android may seem easy to handle as well as straightforward to several customers, but there are still some annoying problems that users have to deal with while trying to disable the lock screen.

What are the top 2 common problems?

Below are the two most common problems faced by Android users during their efforts to disable the feature of screen lock.

**1\. In the Screen Security choice, the None bar can not be chosen.**

Description of the problem: There is a sentence below it stated: "Disabled by administrators, encryption policy or credential storage". All the space of the None option is in white and grey.

The solution to this problem is quite simple. Once you have made sure you are suffering from this nasty one, try to follow these below pieces of advice to see if it is capable of giving you a hand.

Step 1: Open the Settings menu from the main screen. Then tap on the Credential Storage. You will see a drop-down menu like the screenshot below.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![disable lock screen android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14556834486843.jpg)

Step 2: Continue to tap on the Clear Credentials (Remove all certificates) option. Then next click on the OK button. Wait for some seconds until your Android device has finished the process.

Step 3: To make sure that the previous step has been performed successfully, try looking at the bottom of the drop-down menu. If the Clear Credentials (Remove all certificates) are grey out and can not be selected, then you have managed to do it.

![disable lock screen android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14556833184389.jpg)

Step 4: Now that the problem is solved, you can feel free to turn back to your Screen lock option in the beginning and disable the feature of locking screen Android as usual.

2\. You have mistakenly encrypted your SD card. You want to disable the encryption, only to realize that it requires you to set a new screen lock code. But when you come to the Screen lock menu, all the options but Password have been greyed out.

Many people forget their screen lock, and that's normal. That can happen if you accidentally type a new **lock screen password** incorrectly. Apart from that, there are many other explanations too. In short, you can get locked out of your device, which is a terrible experience. It can waste your time if you need something stored in your phone.

Here we have mentioned solutions to let you bypass your **lock screen password.** All the solutions mentioned here are safe and will work almost 100% of the time.

## Part 1: How Can I Set or Change My password?

## Part 2: 4 Simple Ways to Bypass Your Vivo V29 Phone Password

### 1\. Google Find My Device

Our first approach to unlocking your device is to do a factory reset. That erases every one of the data on your phone too. You can perform this method if you have your Google account credentials and are ready. However, we want you to back up your data so you can sign once more after the reset and restore a ton of your data.

Since you're locked out, you will have to utilize a technique to do the reset. The most straightforward way is to utilize Google's Find My Device site. So, if the Find my Device option feature is enabled on your phone, you can tap the **Erase device** choice on this page to reset it.

![google find my device](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/what-is-my-phone-password-3.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 2\. Enter Recovery Mode to Hard Reset

If you can't use the Find my device feature, you'll have to factory reset physically. To do as such:

- Power your device off.
- Hold the Volume (-) and power keys all the while after the screen goes dark to raise Android's bootloader menu. This button blend might be different relying on your device model.
- Press the Volume down button two times to feature the Recovery Mode choice. Then, at that point, press the power button to choose it.
- Hold the power button and press the Volume up button to enter this mode.
- Utilize the volume buttons to go to the Wipe data/Factory Reset choice. Continue with the steps to play out a factory reset.

![wipe data](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/what-is-my-phone-password-4.jpg)

### 3\. Use ADB

This fix isn't guaranteed to work; if you don't watch out, it could damage your phone. Therefore, we suggest you back up everything on your Android before proceeding.

If your phone has USB debugging enabled, is connected to a PC, and is not encrypted, follow these steps:

- Connect your device to your PC through a USB connector.
- Open Command Prompt or Terminal window to your ADB installation registry.
- Type in adb shell rm/data/system/gesture.key and click the Enter key.
- Reboot your phone. When you do, the solid lock screen ought to be gone.
- That is not a permanent condition, so reset your PIN or password lock before you reboot your device once more. That's how you reset **password for phone.**

### 4.Dr.Fone-Screen Unlock

If you want to unlock your phone without losing any data, we suggest Dr.Fone-Screen Unlock. Dr.Fone is a professional unlocking tool that can remove all types of screen locks in minutes.
