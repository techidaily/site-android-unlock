## How to Bypass Android Lock Screen Using Emergency Call On HTC U23 Pro?

The main reason why we keep our smartphone locked is to prevent children (or stalkers) checking out our private photos or messages. You don't want anyone to access your pictures, emails, or other important data. What if you forget your pattern or PIN and cannot access your phone? Or someone changes lock screen pattern to leave you annoyed?

To avoid such types of conditions, we have tried and tested the following methods to bypass the HTC lock screen pattern, PIN, password, and fingerprint.
