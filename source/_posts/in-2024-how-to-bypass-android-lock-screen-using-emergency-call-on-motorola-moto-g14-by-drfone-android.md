### 1\. Google Find My Device

**Step 1:** Open the "Find my Device" webpage from a browser on your PC.

![find my device](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/set-screen-lock-2.jpg)

**Step 2:** Click "Erase my device," which you will see on the left half of your screen. After affirming the Delete capability, your phone will boot into recovery and begin playing out a production line reset. It is difficult to stop or drop on your android gadget when you endorse this activity. Regardless of whether you shut down your Android phone - the reboot will continue on startup.

### 2\. Recovery Mode

Depending on your phone, the steps for this process might vary a little. Most phones will allow you to reset by getting to the recovery mode. Follow the steps below to remove the **Android screen lock:**

**Step 1:** Turn on the Motorola Moto G14 device and enter the boot menu. If you want to know how to do so, you can do a speed search on the internet.

**Step 2:** Access the safe mode, use the volume keys to navigate, and press the Power key to click.

**Step 3:** Search for the Wipe Data option and select it.

![wipe data](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/set-screen-lock-3.jpg)

After that, your Android will start the process, which can require a few minutes. However, this process will erase all your user data.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 3\. Use ADB

This method is very confusing, so follow the steps cautiously on your Android phone to remove the **phone lock**. With your phone connected to your PC, and the cmd open, type the accompanying commands altogether:

- adb shell
- disc/data/data.com.android.providers.settings/databases
- sqlite3 settings.db
- update system set value=0 where name='lock\_pattern\_autoblock';
- update system set value=0 where name='lockscreen.lockedoutpermanently';
- .quit

After you've finished this, reboot your Android phone. If this doesn't reset your lock screen, proceed to the following stage.

With your Android phone connected and the cmd opens, enter:

- abd shell rm/data/system/gesture.key

![cmd command](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/set-screen-lock-4.jpg)

After entering, reboot your phone once more.

### 4\. Boot into Safe Mode

**Step 1:** For most phones and your Android, you can do this by opening the power menu and holding the "Power Off." A message will spring up on your screen, asking whether you might want to Reboot to Safe Mode. Press Ok.

**Step 2:** Clear data from your lock screen application, uninstall and reboot your phone to escape the Safe mode. When you do so, your Android **screen lock** will unlock.

### 5\. Crash Lock Screen

This strategy to sidestep a locked screen is only a crisis workaround for the phones in this classification.

- Enter ten asterisks (\*) through the dialer application.

![ten asterisks](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/set-screen-lock-5.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
- Copy and paste asterisks on the dialer until the "Paste" choice no longer appears.
- Get back to the lock screen and tap on the camera symbol.
- Go to the settings on your Android after pulling down the notifications bar. Now you will have the chance to enter the password, and you must continue the same thing here. Continue to paste until the Android lock screen crashes.
