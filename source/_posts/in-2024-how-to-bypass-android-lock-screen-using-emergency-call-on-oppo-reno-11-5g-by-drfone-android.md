## Rootjunky APK To Bypass Google FRP Lock For Oppo Reno 11 5G 

Factory Reset Protection (FRP) is a security feature built into Android devices running Android 5.1 Lollipop and later versions. It prevents someone from using your phone after a factory data reset without Google account login credentials. The FRP makes it much less attractive for thieves to steal Android phones, knowing they will need help to access them.

FRP automatically activates when you add a Google account to your Android phone. It links the Oppo Reno 11 5G device to your account, making it the “trusted owner.” Once activated, FRP becomes embedded in the phone’s system.

While Google FRP is a valuable security feature, it’s vital to acknowledge that there are legitimate situations where bypassing it might be necessary. These instances include forgotten Google account credentials, buying a second-hand device, and device issues. In these cases, tools like **RootJunky** can help you [<u>bypass FRP Lock</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/google-frp-unlock/bypass-frp-with-computer.html).

### 4\. Hard reset (data loss)

Each brand has a unique method for hard resetting a locked Android device. The methods to factory reset locked Android devices from Samsung, LG, HTC, Sony, and Huawei are compiled here.

When your phone is locked, you may access the recovery menu of your phone using its physical keys and choose to hard reset the Oppo Reno 11 5G device. Here's how to restore a locked phone to factory settings.

- Use the buttons to see the recovery menu.
- Press and hold the Volume Up and Side buttons simultaneously until you see the brand logo on the screen for Android devices without a Power/Bixby/Home button.
- Press and hold the Volume Up, Bixby, and Power buttons all at once if your smartphone has a Power button. Releasing them before a logo arises is advised.
- Use the Volume Down key to highlight Wipe data/factory reset when the Android system recovery option displays, then hit the Power/Bixby key to choose it.
- Allow a few seconds for the factory reset procedure to finish after selecting Yes, or Factory data reset. The phone will reboot once you pick the Reboot system. Now you may configure it as if it were a brand-new gadget.
