### Rooting and Flashing a New ROM To Remove Knox Enrollment Service

For the more tech-savvy users, another method to **bypass Knox Enrollment Service** is by rooting the Oppo A79 5G device and flashing a new ROM. This process involves gaining root access to the Oppo A79 5G device’s operating system, which allows you to modify the software extensively.
