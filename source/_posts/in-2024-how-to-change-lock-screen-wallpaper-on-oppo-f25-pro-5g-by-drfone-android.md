## Part 1: Remove Previously Synced Google Account from Android Phone Without Phone Reset

In this part, we will discuss the methods that can be used for removing the previously synced account from your Android phone without a phone reset.

### Method 1: Removing Google Account using the Android Settings Menu

The steps for this method are listed below.

- **Step 1:** On your Android phone go to the Settings option and choose Accounts & Backup.
- **Step 2:** Select the Manage Accounts option now and the list of the associated Google Devices will appear.
- **Step 3:** Choose and click on the Google Account that you want to remove and a pop-up message will appear to inform you that all the account data will be deleted with this action.

To confirm the removal of the account, click on the Remove account button.

### Method 2: Remove the Google account from the Android phone using the computer

There is another method using which you can remotely remove the Google account associated with your phone. The steps for the method are listed below.

- **Step 1:** Using another device or a PC, sign in to your Google account that was previously synced on this device and choose the Security option.
- **Step 2:** Next scroll down and then tap on the Your devices option and choose to Manage devices.
- **Step 3:** You will now see the list of devices linked to your Google account. Next, tap on Find a lost or stolen phone and then select the Remove option present next to Account access.
