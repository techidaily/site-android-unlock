## Part 1. How Do I Put a Clock on My Android Lock Screen?

Android devices running version 12 or later come with the clock feature activated by default. Take note that its appearance may change under specific circumstances. It can change when there are unread notifications visible on the lock screen.

For devices running Android 11, **changing the lock screen clock** is still available. In some instances, you can even customize its style by following these simple steps:

- **Step 1**: For users with Android 11 or older, go to **Settings** > **Lock screen & security**. Depending on your phone model, tap **Lock screen** or **Security**.

![customizing android lock screen clock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/change-lock-screen-clock-02.jpg)

- **Step 2: G**o to **Customize Lock screen** > **Clock**. Next, customize or activate the lock screen clock.

**Note**

The exact names of settings may change depending on the manufacturer and version of Android. But the navigation should be similar.

## Part 2. How To Change Lock Screen Clock on Android \[5 Methods\]

Currently, there isn’t an official method to **change the lock screen clock on Android** 12. However, there are several workarounds you can do. Let’s explore these techniques and see which works best for you.

### Method 1: Change Your Wallpaper

In Android 11, adjusting your wallpaper is accessible through the Android Settings menu.

- **Step 1A:** Navigate to the “All Apps” screen and select **Settings**. For Samsung Galaxy devices on Android 11, access the **Wallpaper** option within the settings menu.

![wallpaper settings on android 11](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/change-lock-screen-clock-03.jpg)

In Android 12, the process remains consistent.

- **Step 1:** Locate the **Wallpaper & style** button within the **Settings** menu**.**

![wallpaper settings on android 12](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/change-lock-screen-clock-04.jpg)

- **Step 2**: Follow the provided instructions to transform your lock screen experience. Replace the oversized clock with dynamic, changing wallpapers.

### Method 2: Turn Off the Always-On Display

An alternative to avoid **the Android lock screen clock** is disabling the Always-on Display (AOD).

- **Step 1**: Access the **Settings** menu on your Android device. Scroll down and choose **Lock** **screen** > **Always On Display**.

![android always on display setting](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/change-lock-screen-clock-05.jpg)

- **Step 2:** Toggle off to deactivate the **Always On Display**.

**_**_Note_**_**

**While this won’t alter the lock screen clock itself, it will turn off the display. It will prevent the constant presence of the lock screen clock. Instead, the clock will only become visible when you press the power button.**

### Method 3: Disable the Double-Line Clock

Originally, there was no provision to **change the lock screen clock in Android 12**. With the release of a new update, Google introduced an option to deactivate the clock, bringing relief to users. Follow the steps below to disable the double-line clock on your Android.

- **Step 1:** Go to **Settings** > **Display**. Next, choose **Lock screen**.

![double line clock android settings](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/change-lock-screen-clock-06.jpg)

- **Step 2:** Toggle the **Double-line clock** off.

**_**_Note_**_**

**If you want to display a digital or analog clock, open the** **_**_Clock_**_** **app. Tap the** **_**_three dots_**_** **>** **_**_Settings_**_** **>** **_**_Style_**_****.**

### Method 4: Turn On Screensaver

An alternative method to modify the **Android lock screen clock** involves activating Android’s screen saver. There are options where it’s more pleasing than the default lock screen clock. If you want to **change the lock screen clock**, follow the steps.

- **Step 1:** Open the **Clock** app and tap the **three dots** in the upper-right corner. Select **Screensaver** and toggle it on.

![screensaver and new lock screen clock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/change-lock-screen-clock-07.jpg)

- **Step 2**: If you want to customize the screensaver clock’s appearance, go to **Settings** > **Display** > **Screensaver.** Choose analog, digital, or night mode.

### Method 5: Keep Unread Notifications

To avoid adjusting your Android device settings, you can make the lock screen clock smaller by maintaining unread notifications. The clock occupies less space when there are unread notifications. It shifts back to the top-left corner when you receive a new notification. Simply leave notifications unread to keep the clock smaller.

![unread notifications on android lock screen](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/change-lock-screen-clock-08.jpg)

### Bonus

For users who prefer not to have a lock screen clock, follow these steps:

- **Step 1**: Open **Settings** > **Lock screen** or **Security & lock screen**.
- **Step 2**: Look for **Clock and FaceWidgets** or a similar option. Disable or toggle off the **Clock** or **Show clock** setting. Save changes, and your lock screen should no longer display the clock.

- **Step 1**: Go to **Settings** > **Lock screen** or **Lock screen & security**.Choose **Customize lock screen** > **Clock**, **Clock** **style,** or **Lock screen clock**.
