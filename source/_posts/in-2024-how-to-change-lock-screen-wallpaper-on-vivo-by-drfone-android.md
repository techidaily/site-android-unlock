### Steps To Use vnROM Bypass

Using the vnROM Bypass on your devices turns out to be a simple procedure. Below are the steps for utilizing the vnROM Bypass:

- **Step 1.** Access vnROM's official website via your browser and download the APK file onto a USB drive. This APK serves as the primary application for initiating the bypass. Power up the locked phone and follow the on-screen instructions to set up the mobile device. During the setup process, connect the USB drive to your phone using an OTG cable when prompted to verify your account.
- **Step 2.** Install the vnROM bypass APK from the USB drive onto the Vivo S18e device. Once the APK is installed, navigate to the Vivo S18e device's "Settings" menu and perform a factory reset. Upon completion of the factory reset, the Vivo S18e device will automatically restart. Proceed to set up your phone without providing your Google account credentials.
