## Part 1: What should I be aware of before resetting a Vivo Y200  Phone that is locked?

Before you go to reset your locked Vivo Y200  phone, it's crucial to learn about a few key factors. These factors will enable you to make a well-informed choice and help avoid potential complications during the factory reset process.

### 1\. Data Loss

Resetting your locked Vivo Y200  phone typically involves performing a factory reset. The process erases all data and settings on the Vivo Y200 device. This includes your files, apps, contacts, and other information stored on the phone. You can easily restore these data if you have backed up data before. It's crucial to [back up essential data](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/android-backup-and-restore/) regularly to avoid data loss.

### 2\. Factory Reset Protection (FRP)

Vivo Y200 , like many other Android manufacturers, implements Factory Reset Protection. It acts as a preemptive safeguard against unauthorized access to a device after a reset. If your phone is linked to a Google account, you will need to input the accurate login credentials after a reset.

Failing to do so may lead to your device being locked. Understanding how to bypass or recover from FRP lock is essential if you find yourself in this situation.
