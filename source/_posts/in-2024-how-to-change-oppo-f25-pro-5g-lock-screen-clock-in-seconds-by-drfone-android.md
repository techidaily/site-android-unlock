## How to Unlock a Network Locked Oppo F25 Pro 5G Phone?

Revolutions in the telecommunication industry have introduced advancements in smartphone features and utilities. The other side of the coin is, however, not as appealing. Thanks to the different carrier services, network locking is the commonest issue of recent mobile launches. Users have reported of Oppo F25 Pro 5G phones refusing to work with different carriers.

The issue limits the smartphone's functioning to the specific carrier from whom the Oppo F25 Pro 5G device is purchased. Consequently, there are annoying connectivity problems that restrict seamless mobile usage. The problem aggravates in geo-restricted regions where the carrier options are quite limited. This scenario puts forward the need for **Oppo F25 Pro 5G network unlock** solutions.

## Forgot Pattern Lock? Here's How You Can Unlock Oppo F25 Pro 5G Pattern Lock Screen

Forgetting the pattern lock of a device and getting locked out of it is probably one of the most frustrating scenarios faced by Android users. Nevertheless, unlike popular operating systems, Android provides a seamless way to past the forgot pattern lock feature.

You can either try Google’s native solution or a third-party tool in case you have forgotten the pattern lock on your device and reset it.

## Part 1: How to bypass forgot pattern lock using the 'Forgot Pattern' feature?

One of the easiest and fastest ways to fix the forgot pattern lock issue on a device is by using its inbuilt “Forgot Pattern” feature. If you are using an Android 4.4 or earlier version, then you can simply access this feature. Since users can hack an Android device just by knowing the Google credentials of the connected device, the solution was later discontinued (as it was considered a security vulnerability). Nevertheless, if your device hasn’t been updated and you are using an Android 4.4 or previous version, then you can bypass the forgot pattern lock by following these steps:

**Step 1.** Firstly, provide the wrong pattern to your device. It will let you know that you applied the incorrect pattern.

**Step 2.** On the same prompt, you can see an option of “Forgot pattern” on the bottom. Simply tap on it.

**Step 3.** This will open a new screen, which can be used to bypass the forgotten pattern of Android. Select the option for entering the Google Account details and proceed.

**Step 4.** To reset the forgot pattern lock, you need to provide the correct Google credentials of the account already linked to the Oppo F25 Pro 5G device.

![enter google account](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/09/15059290192675.jpg)
