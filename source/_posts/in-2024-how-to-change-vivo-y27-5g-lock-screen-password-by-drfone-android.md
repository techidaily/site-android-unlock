## How To Change Vivo Y27 5G Lock Screen Password?

Setting up a lock screen is a crucial step in protecting your phone's data. If you're not sure how to create one on your Android™ phone, we're here to help.

Your Android lock screen pin or password and your Google Account password are two passwords you use frequently. Keeping a good lock screen passcode is important.

Although you might not frequently enter your lock screen pin or password if you use a biometric unlocking method like fingerprint or facial recognition, it's still important to be familiar with it.

You'll need to reset your Google Account password if you forget it or become locked out for some other reason when you try to keep accessing all of your data. You might also need to change lock screen passcode from time to time.

## Part 2: 4 Simple Ways to Bypass Your Vivo Y27 5G Phone Password

### Method 2: Turn Off the Always-On Display

An alternative to avoid **the Android lock screen clock** is disabling the Always-on Display (AOD).

- **Step 1**: Access the **Settings** menu on your Android device. Scroll down and choose **Lock** **screen** > **Always On Display**.

![android always on display setting](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/change-lock-screen-clock-05.jpg)

- **Step 2:** Toggle off to deactivate the **Always On Display**.

**_**_Note_**_**

**While this won’t alter the lock screen clock itself, it will turn off the display. It will prevent the constant presence of the lock screen clock. Instead, the clock will only become visible when you press the power button.**

### Method 3: Disable the Double-Line Clock

Originally, there was no provision to **change the lock screen clock in Android 12**. With the release of a new update, Google introduced an option to deactivate the clock, bringing relief to users. Follow the steps below to disable the double-line clock on your Android.

- **Step 1:** Go to **Settings** > **Display**. Next, choose **Lock screen**.

- **Step 2**: If you want to customize the screensaver clock’s appearance, go to **Settings** > **Display** > **Screensaver.** Choose analog, digital, or night mode.

### Method 5: Keep Unread Notifications

To avoid adjusting your Android device settings, you can make the lock screen clock smaller by maintaining unread notifications. The clock occupies less space when there are unread notifications.
