It is a wise option to get your device locked by Android Device Manager in case it is lost or stolen, so that your phone is secured.

- • Lastly, Android Device Manager is not compatible for all Android versions. For now, it is only compatible with devices running Android 4.4 and above, so your phone must be in this category for ADM to work.
