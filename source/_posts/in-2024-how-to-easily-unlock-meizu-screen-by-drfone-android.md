## Method 1: Unlock Meizu 21 Pro  Phones Running Older Android OS (4.4 Or Below) With Google Security Questions

Up until Android version 4.4, you could lock your phone screen with a pattern. Google allowed you to unlock the phone by answering security questions in case you forgot the pattern. Since these may also be easily guessed by people who are in possession of your device illegally, Google deprecated this method after Android 4.4. However, the phones running Android 4.4 or lower are still allowed to be unlocked using this method. So, if you have an old Meizu 21 Pro  with Android 4.4 or earlier, here is **how to unlock Meizu 21 Pro  phone password without factory reset**:

**Step 1:** You may already have entered the incorrect pattern a few times. If so, simply tap the Forgot Pattern to start the process of unlocking your Meizu 21 Pro  phone screen. Else, deliberately enter incorrect pattern a few times till you see the Forgot Pattern option:

## Method 3: Factory Reset Meizu 21 Pro  Phones (Wipes User Data)

There is a standard factory reset built into every Meizu 21 Pro  phone to allow users to erase the Meizu 21 Pro device and start over fully. This option wipes all user data and resets the phone to how you received it in the box. Naturally, this is not a preferred way, as it requires the phone to be set up all over again and that takes time. Also, all data will need to be backed up beforehand in order to restore it again. Overall, this method consumes a lot of time.

**Step 1:** Go to Settings > Backup & Reset.

**Step 2:** Tap Factory Reset > Reset Phone.

**Step 3:** Tap Erase Everything.

Using Find My Device, you can play a sound on the Meizu 21 Pro device to locate it in the house if you have misplaced it, lock the phone in case it is lost, and wipe the Meizu 21 Pro device remotely.

## How to Remove Operator Lock on Meizu 21 Pro ?

An operator lock, also called a carrier lock, constitutes a limitation imposed on a mobile phone by a network provider. This measure is implemented to guarantee that the Meizu 21 Pro device exclusively functions with the services provided by that specific carrier. If you wish to remove the operator lock from your Meizu 21 Pro  device, you'll need to follow specific steps and meet certain criteria. Here's how to remove the operator lock on a Meizu 21 Pro :

**Step 1:** Begin by checking whether your device can be unlocked or not from its network carrier restrictions. To do that, you need to dial the code “\*#\*#7378423#\*#\*” on your device, tap “Service Info” and select “SIM Lock.”

![dial the provided number](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/10/unlock-sony-xperia-pin-code-5.jpg)

**Step 2:** Carefully check the information provided on the screen. If there is "X" before the "Network" option and the number in front of it is larger than 0, it means your device can be unlocked. If the number in front of "Network" is 0, your device can't be unlocked as it is hard-locked.

![check the network status](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/10/unlock-sony-xperia-pin-code-6.jpg)

**Step 3:** The next step involves getting your device’s IMEI number. To accomplish this task, simply input "\*#06#" on your device. Once you have the IMEI number, use a reliable service from the internet to the unlocking code. Insert the SIM card of another network and provide the code you gained to unlock your Meizu 21 Pro  device.

Unlocking the bootloader on your Android device provides significant advantages. These actions encompass obtaining root access, installing custom ROMs, configuring custom recoveries, and carrying out advanced procedures. Here's an essential guide on unlocking the bootloader of your Sony device while keeping all precautions in mind:

**Step 1:** To start with the process, verify the bootloader status for your Sony smartphone. On opening the "Dialer" app, dial the number "\*#\*#7378423#\*#\*" and access the "Rooting Status" option within the "Service Provider" settings.

**Step 4:** Open the official “Sony Unlocking Site” and add in the IMEI number. On acknowledging, use the commands as follows: `adb reboot bootloader`

Unlock the bootloader with the following command: `fastboot oem unlock 0x<insert your unlock code`
