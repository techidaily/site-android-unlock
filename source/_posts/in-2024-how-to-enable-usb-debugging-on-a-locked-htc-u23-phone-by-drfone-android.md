## Method 1: Unlock HTC U23  Phones Running Older Android OS (4.4 Or Below) With Google Security Questions

Up until Android version 4.4, you could lock your phone screen with a pattern. Google allowed you to unlock the phone by answering security questions in case you forgot the pattern.

However, the phones running Android 4.4 or lower are still allowed to be unlocked using this method. So, if you have an old HTC U23  with Android 4.4 or earlier, here is **how to unlock HTC U23  phone password without factory reset**:

**Step 1:** You may already have entered the incorrect pattern a few times. If so, simply tap the Forgot Pattern to start the process of unlocking your HTC U23  phone screen. Else, deliberately enter incorrect pattern a few times till you see the Forgot Pattern option:

## Method 3: Factory Reset HTC U23  Phones (Wipes User Data)

There is a standard factory reset built into every HTC U23  phone to allow users to erase the HTC U23 device and start over fully. This option wipes all user data and resets the phone to how you received it in the box. Naturally, this is not a preferred way, as it requires the phone to be set up all over again and that takes time. Also, all data will need to be backed up beforehand in order to restore it again. Overall, this method consumes a lot of time.

**Step 1:** Go to Settings > Backup & Reset.

**Step 2:** Tap Factory Reset > Reset Phone.

**Step 3:** Tap Erase Everything.

## Method 4: Use Google Find My Device To Unlock HTC U23  Phones (Wipes User Data)

Google Find My Device is an online service by Google that is used to locate and track your Android devices. It works like how Apple's Find My works for its range of hardware. Using Find My Device, you can play a sound on the HTC U23 device to locate it in the house if you have misplaced it, lock the phone in case it is lost, and wipe the HTC U23 device remotely.

**Step 1:** Go to <https://accounts.google.com>.

**Step 2:** Log in and go to Security > Your Devices:

![unlock motorola phone with google](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/09/full-guide-to-unlock-motorola-phones-10.jpg)

**Step 5:** Click Erase Device and confirm.

**Step 6:** After the erasure, your device will need to be set up all over again.

## Method 5: Request Service Provider To Unlock Your HTC U23  Phone

If your HTC U23  phone is tied to a service contract and you want to unlock your device to use it with other service providers, this method is for you. You can request your service provider to unlock your HTC U23  phone provided their conditions are met. Usually, they will be happy to oblige if there are no dues and the service period is over.

## The Ultimate Guide: How to Bypass Swipe Screen to Unlock on HTC U23 Device

Nowadays, the security mode is enabled in almost all digital devices, which is the case with our smartphones. However, when we repeatedly change our password, we might be in a state of confusion to remember it.
