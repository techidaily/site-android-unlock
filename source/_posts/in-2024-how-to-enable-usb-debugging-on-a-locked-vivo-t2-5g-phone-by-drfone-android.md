**Step 4**: The phone will perform the factory reset. In a short while, restart your device and there will be no lock screen.

### Way 4: Unlock Pattern Lock with Android Device Manager

Android Device Manager unlocking is the second-best service for bypassing the Android lock screen on locked Android devices and tablets. Working on this service is quite straightforward, and it only works if the user has a Google account. This service is accessible and usable from any device or computer.

![unlock android screen 15](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/12/android-device-manager-1.jpg)

There are a few things to keep in mind as you use this service to get around the lock screen. If the Android device is compatible, the Android Device Manager will connect it after a few tries. After it has been connected to the Vivo T2 5G device, we can begin by pressing the "Lock" button.

After pressing the "Lock" button, a popup will appear, asking for a new password to replace the forgotten pin, pattern, or password.

![unlock android screen 16](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/12/android-device-manager-2.jpg)

Type the new password once, then confirm it by typing it again. This will change the password in a few minutes and the new password can be used to unlock the Vivo T2 5G device.

### Way 5: Use Forgot Pattern Feature \[Android 4.4 Version and Earlier\]

If you use an older Android version, you can get rid of the **universal unlock pattern** by forgot pattern feature. On earlier Android devices, this feature is enabled by default. After a few failed attempts, the warning "Try again in 30 seconds" appears and here is where the steps begin. Let us get to know in detail.
