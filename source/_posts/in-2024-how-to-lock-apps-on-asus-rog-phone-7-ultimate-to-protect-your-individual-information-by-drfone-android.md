In other words, the feature overrides an Android phone's Lock Screen feature, thereby saving users the need to enter passwords every time the Asus ROG Phone 7 Ultimate device locks.

If you're at home, it's likely your android phone is locked out if you haven't accessed at for some time. Smart Locks solves the problem in many ways. It allows you to allocate trusted places. Once you within range of the trusted places, your phone won't lock. Trusted devices come next. Smart Lock is assigned to Bluetooth and Android NFC unlock devices.

The feature recognizes your face and then unlocks the Asus ROG Phone 7 Ultimate device. Once you set up the Asus ROG Phone 7 Ultimate device to recognize your face as a trusted face, it will unlock the Asus ROG Phone 7 Ultimate device as soon as it recognizes you.

![smart lock android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14555208588486.jpg)

PRECAUTION:¬† At best, this can be the first level of security, as one who resembles you to some extent can unlock the Asus ROG Phone 7 Ultimate device. Photographs are not stored in the system. The device does hold necessary data to recognize your face, and the security level is determined by how good the Asus ROG Phone 7 Ultimate device is configured. The data is not accessed by any app or loaded onto a Google server for backup.

_Setting Up Trusted Face_

- ‚Ä¢ Go to Smart Lock and tap Trusted Face.
