## How to Unlock a Network Locked Lava Yuva 2 Phone?

Revolutions in the telecommunication industry have introduced advancements in smartphone features and utilities. The other side of the coin is, however, not as appealing. Thanks to the different carrier services, network locking is the commonest issue of recent mobile launches. Users have reported of Lava Yuva 2 phones refusing to work with different carriers.

The issue limits the smartphone's functioning to the specific carrier from whom the Lava Yuva 2 device is purchased. Consequently, there are annoying connectivity problems that restrict seamless mobile usage. The problem aggravates in geo-restricted regions where the carrier options are quite limited. This scenario puts forward the need for **Lava Yuva 2 network unlock** solutions.

## Part 1: What Does It Mean When Your Lava Yuva 2 Phone is Network Locked?

In the simplest words, a network-locked Lava Yuva 2 phone means that your device has become carrier-specific. It will now work only with the network provider from where the phone was purchased.

Having a network-locked Lava Yuva 2 phone poses undesired connectivity issues.

### 1\. Why is my phone locked to the network carrier?

Smartphones are network locked by carrier services to prevent customers from switching to a different carrier. Reasons for switching can be the availability of better plans, discounts, etc. Another cause of locking the phones to specific carriers is preventing them from theft and unauthorized usage.

### 2\. Is it legal to unlock it?

Unlocking your network-locked phone is legal in every sense. It is however advisable to contact your service provider for addressing the concern. The only downside of unlocking such phones is the loss of device warranty assured at the time of purchase.
