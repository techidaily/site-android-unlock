## How to Lock Apps on Vivo X100 Pro to Protect Your Individual Information

If you are not a fan of having to go through the process of getting through a [pattern](https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/pattern-lock.html) or password every time you want to use your phone, the good news is that you don’t have to. There are really just a few Apps on your Android device that have sensitive information you don’t want others getting access to. It would really be great if you could lock those apps individually as opposed to locking the Vivo X100 Pro device as a whole.

Well, in light of helping you out, this article will address just how you can lock Apps on your device and not have to type in a code every time you want to use the Vivo X100 Pro device.

## Part 1. Why you need to Lock Apps on Android?

Before we get down to the business of locking some of your Apps, let’s look at some of the reasons why you would want to lock certain apps.

- You may simply want better access on your device. Locking certain apps will allow you to easily access the Vivo X100 Pro device and use it without having to remember passwords and patterns.
- If you are a person who is not good at remembering passwords or patterns, simply locking certain apps will help you not get locked out of your entire device which can cause a lot of problems.
- If your device is used by more than one person, locking certain apps will keep the other users out of information you would rather they didn’t access.
- If you have children, you can eliminate the many accidental in-app purchases by locking the apps your children shouldn’t be on.
- Locking apps is also a good way to keep children from content they shouldn’t be accessing.

## Part 2. How to Lock Apps in Android

There is always a good reason to Lock Apps on your device and we have two easy and effective methods you can use to do this. Choose the one that you are most comfortable with.

## Part 3. 6 Private Apps that you should lock on your Android

There are certain apps that may require to be locked more than others. Of course the choice of which apps you should lock will depend on your own uses and preferences. The following are some of the apps you would like to lock for one reason or another.

### 1\. The Messaging App

This is the application that allows you to send and receive messages. You may want to lock this app if you use your device to send messages of a sensitive nature that you would rather keep private. You may also want to lock this app if your device is used by more than one person and you don’t want other users reading your messages.

### 2\. Email App

Most people use individual email applications such as Yahoo Mail App or Gmail. This is another critical one if you are going to protect your work emails. You may want to lock the email app if your work emails are sensitive in nature and contain information that is not for all individuals.

![lock app on android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/android-lock-apps-09.jpg)

### 3\. Google Play Services

This is the application that allows you to download and install applications to your device. You may want to lock this one if you are trying to prevent other users from downloading and installing further apps to your device. This is especially valuable if your device is utilized by children.

![lock app on android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/android-lock-apps-10.jpg)

### 4\. Gallery App

The Gallery app displays all the images on your device. The main reason you may want to lock the Gallery app may be because you have sensitive images that are not suitable for all viewers. Again this is ideal if children make use of your device and you have images that you would rather they didn’t see.

## Part 1: Ways That Vivo Lets You Unlock Your Vivo X100 Pro

Vivo X100 Pro  are more than just smartphones; they are gateways to a personalized and secure user experience. To access the myriad of features these devices offer, Google provides several unlocking methods, ensuring both convenience and security. Here are these options:

Setting up a PIN is straightforward via the Vivo X100 Pro device’s security settings, and unlocking your phone is as easy as tapping in the correct sequence of numbers.
- Similar to a PIN but potentially more secure due to the allowance of a longer combination of numbers and letters. A passcode is ideal for those who seek an extra layer of security. You set it up in the security settings and use it to unlock your phone just like a PIN but with the added complexity of alphanumeric characters.
- **Face Unlock.Pixel’s Face Unlock** uses advanced facial recognition software. It scans your face to grant access, offering a hands-free and quick way to unlock your Pixel. This feature can be activated in the security settings and requires a simple glance at your phone to unlock.

![woman holding a Vivo X100 Pro](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/google-pixel-7-unlock-02.jpg)

- [**<u><b>Fingerprint Unlock</b></u>**](https://drfone.wondershare.com/google-frp-unlock/google-pixel-frp-bypass.html)**.** This method uses your unique fingerprint as a key. It’s fast, secure, and convenient. The Pixel 6a, 6, and 7 fingerprint scanners are actually under the display. Register your fingerprint in the settings, then touch the sensor to gain access.
- **Pattern**. If you prefer a more visual method, the [<u>pattern lock</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/mi-pattern-lock.html) lets you draw a specific shape or pattern on the screen to unlock your phone. It’s a fun and interactive way to secure your device. Create your pattern in the security settings, and unlock your phone by replicating it on the lock screen.

In essence, each unlocking method offered by the Vivo X100 Pro  provides a blend of security and ease. Whichever unlocking method you prefer, Google ensures that accessing your phone is secure and convenient. All you need to do is set up your preferred method in the Vivo X100 Pro device’s settings and use it to unlock your phone.

_**Tips:** Is your Pixel locked accidently? Are you searching for a powerful tool? No worries as [Dr.Fone](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare-dr-fone-unlock-android-screen/) is here to help you. Download it and start a seamless unlock experience!_

### Method 2: Entering Into Safe Mode

Safe Mode is a diagnostic mode in Android that can help bypass third-party lock screen apps. It’s useful if you’ve used a third-party app for your lock screen.

To do this, press the power button, then long-press on the **Power off** option. Tap **OK** when **Reboot to safe mode** option appears. In Safe Mode, third-party apps are disabled. Thus, you can now access your device if a third-party app is causing lock issues.

### Method 3: Force Resetting a Device/Flashing a New ROM

Force resetting or flashing a new ROM can be considered a last resort. They involve erasing all data on your device or installing a new operating system.

- **Force resetting your device**. To force reset your Vivo, press and hold the Power and Volume Down buttons simultaneously to enter recovery mode. Use the volume buttons to navigate to **Wipe data/factory reset**and select it with the power button. This will get rid of existing password locks.
- **Flashing a new ROM**. This is more complex and typically requires downloading a new firmware and flashing tool. It’s only recommended for advanced users or as a last resort.

Remember, while these methods can effectively unlock your device, they also come with risks. Always [<u>back up your data regularly</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/backup/android-backup-software.html), and use these methods responsibly, considering their potential to erase your data or affect your device’s warranty.

## Bonus: How To Perform a SIM Unlock on Vivo

This process can be accomplished for free through your carrier, provided certain conditions are met. Dive into the steps and considerations for performing a SIM unlock on your Vivo.

This generally involves the following steps:

- **Step 1**: Like the previous method, retrieve your IMEI number by dialing \*#06# on your Pixel.
- **Step 2:** Go to the Android SIM unlock provider’s website and enter your device’s IMEI number.
- **Step 3:** Follow through with the checkout process, providing payment and contact information.

By following these steps, you can successfully unlock the SIM of your Vivo device, ensuring you can enjoy your phone with the carrier of your choice, wherever your travels may take you.
