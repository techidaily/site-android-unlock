## Method 1. Google Find My Device (Without Password/Pin/Pattern)

If you're like me, you've probably tried a million different ways to unlock your HTC phone, only to be frustrated by the results. Luckily, there's an easy way to unlock your HTC phone using Google's Find My Device feature.

Google will use your location, phone information, and connection log to find your Nokia.
