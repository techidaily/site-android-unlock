## Rootjunky APK To Bypass Google FRP Lock For Lenovo ThinkPhone

Factory Reset Protection (FRP) is a security feature built into Android devices running Android 5.1 Lollipop and later versions.

FRP automatically activates when you add a Google account to your Android phone. It links the Lenovo ThinkPhone device to your account, making it the âtrusted owner.â Once activated, FRP becomes embedded in the phoneâs system.
