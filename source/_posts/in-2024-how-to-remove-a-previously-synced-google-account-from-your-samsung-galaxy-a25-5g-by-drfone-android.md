## Part 1: How to bypass forgot pattern lock using the 'Forgot Pattern' feature?

One of the easiest and fastest ways to fix the forgot pattern lock issue on a device is by using its inbuilt “Forgot Pattern” feature. If you are using an Android 4.4 or earlier version, then you can simply access this feature.

Nevertheless, if your device hasn’t been updated and you are using an Android 4.4 or previous version, then you can bypass the forgot pattern lock by following these steps:

**Step 1.** Firstly, provide the wrong pattern to your device. It will let you know that you applied the incorrect pattern.

**Step 2.** On the same prompt, you can see an option of “Forgot pattern” on the bottom. Simply tap on it.

**Step 1:** Turn off your Samsung device and connect it to your computer. Now press and hold “Volume Up” and “Power” keys for a while. Release the keys once the Samsung Galaxy A25 5G device enters Recovery Mode.

**Step 2:** In Recovery Mode, use the Volume keys to navigate to “Wipe data/factory reset” and select it with the “Power” key. Confirm the action on the next screen by selecting “Factory data reset.”
