## Part 1: How To Track Your Vivo V27 Pro on Google Earth

This **Google Maps IMEI number tracking** issue has caused quite a buzz and controversy on the internet. It has raised many concerns regarding the safety and privacy of every smartphone user. To tell you the truth, Google Earth lacks IMEI location data and does not provide such capabilities. Thus, there is no truth in **tracking IMEI numbers through Google Earth**.

**Step 6.** ADB terminal will pop out. Now, the first is to type in ADBÂ _devices_. This is to check if your device is recognized by ADB. If there is no device listed below, try to remove and reconnect your Vivo V27 Pro and retype the command. If there are listed devices already, proceed.

**Step 7.** Finally, type in the following commands **one by one****.** These commands will remove your lock screen.

- _adb shell_
- _cd /data/data/com.android.providers.settings/databases_
- _sqlite3 settings.db_
- _update system set value=0 where_
- _name='lock\_pattern\_autolock';_
- _update system set value=0 where_
- _name='lockscreen.lockedoutpermanently';_
- _.quit_

This would work if you have your USB debugging turned on before it was locked. That's how to unlock Android using ADB.
