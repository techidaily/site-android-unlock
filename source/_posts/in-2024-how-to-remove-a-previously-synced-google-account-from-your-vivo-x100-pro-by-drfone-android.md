- Press and hold the “Volume Down” and "Side/Power" buttons till the Vivo logo appears on display. Then, at that point, your phone is in recovery mode.
- Utilize the volume keys to pick the "Wipe Data/Factory Reset" choice, and press the "Side/Power" button to select it. Then, at that point, pick "Yes" to go on. You can reboot your Vivo after the reset is finished, and the lock will be no more.
