### 1\. Change or Remove in Settings

When you go to Settings > Lock Screen > Screen lock type, several lock screen options are available. These options are given below:

**Swipe:**

You can unlock your phone by swiping in any direction on its screen.

**Pattern:**

You will draw a pattern on a 3-by-3 grid of dots to unlock your phone this way. To do this, you'll need to use your finger to connect the dots in the pattern.

**Phone Pin:**

When you choose a PIN, make sure it's something easy to remember. But choose wisely- a PIN that's too easy to guess can put your account at risk.

**Password:**

It is the highest level of security available for your phone. Passwords should contain seven characters, of which at least one must be a letter. They should also be both unique and memorable.

**Face recognition:**

By holding your face directly in front of the phone screen, you can unlock your phone and verify yourself in apps.

**Fingerprints:**

Touch your phone to open it quickly and easily.

**Iris:**

Verify that only the contents of your phone are visible to your eyes.

**Intelligent Scan:**

Unlock your device with both facial and iris recognition.

Unless you can get it unlocked, your phone is useless, and all of your important photos, text messages, and content are all locked out of your reach. While right now, nothing can do without a Google account. But you can try to reset your Google account first.

## Part 1: How to Bypass Lock Screen on Android device with Google Account (Android Device Manager)
