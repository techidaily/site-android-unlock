If you've forgotten your screen lock pin, there's no need to worry. Here are quick and easy ways to remove the screen lock PIN on your Android device.

**Swipe:**

When you choose a PIN, make sure it's something easy to remember. But choose wisely- a PIN that's too easy to guess can put your account at risk.

**Password:**

It is the highest level of security available for your phone. Passwords should contain seven characters, of which at least one must be a letter. They should also be both unique and memorable.

**Face recognition:**

By holding your face directly in front of the phone screen, you can unlock your phone and verify yourself in apps.

**Fingerprints:**

Touch your phone to open it quickly and easily.

**Iris:**

Verify that only the contents of your phone are visible to your eyes.

**Intelligent Scan:**

Unlock your device with both facial and iris recognition.

After following these steps, you can easily overcome how to unlock the Vivo phone forgot password issue.

## Solution 6: Unlock Vivo Phone Using ADB Command (need USB debugging enabled)

This might be a little complicated initially, but if you don't want to follow either of the above-mentioned techniques to unlock your device, you can go with this alternative. Before proceeding, make sure that you have ADB (Android Debug Bridge) installed on your computer. If you don't have it, then you can download Android SDK right [here](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html).

Additionally, it would help if you turned on the USB Debugging feature on your phone before you forgot the password. If USB debugging is not turned on before, then this method will not work for you.

After making your device ready and downloading all the essential software on your computer, follow these steps to learn how to unlock your Vivo phone if you forgot the password.

- **Step 1.** Connect your device to the computer with a USB cable and open the command prompt when it is successfully connected. If you get a pop-up message regarding USB Debugging permission on your device, simply agree to it and continue.

- **Step 2.** Now, please provide the following code on the command prompt and reboot your device when it is processed. If you want, you can also tweak the code a little and provide a new lock pin.

- _ADB_ _shell_
- _cd /data/data/com.android.providers.settings/databases_
- _sqlite3 settings.__db_
- _update system set value=0 where name='lock\_pattern\_autolock';_
- _update system set value=0 where name='lockscreen__.lockedoutpermanently';_
- _.quit_

![unlock lg forgot password - command code](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/03/14892205231542.jpg)

- **Step 3.** If the above code doesn't work, try providing the code “ADB _shell rm /data/system/gesture. the key_” to it and follow the same drill.

![unlock lg forgot password - code](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/03/14892205424871.jpg)

## Part 1: What Is the Emergency Call Bypass Method?

The **Android emergency call bypass** method is a lesser-known workaround for those unfortunate moments when you’re locked out of your phone. This method exploits a loophole in the phone’s lock screen, allowing you to access your device even when you’ve [<u>forgotten your password, PIN, or pattern</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/9-ways-to-bypass-samsung-lock-screen-pattern-pin-password-fingerprint.html). It’s like finding a secret backdoor when the front door is bolted shut.

**“How can unlocking Vivo, Oppo, and Samsung phones using emergency calls** be effective?” You may ask. Imagine you need to access important information on your phone but can’t remember your lock screen code. Instead of panicking or rushing to a technician, the emergency call bypass can be a quick and handy solution. It’s particularly useful when immediate access to your phone is crucial and you don’t have time to [<u>reset your password </u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/reset-android/how-to-reset-privacy-password-in-oppo.html) through official channels.

### Limitations of the Emergency Call Bypass Method

However, it’s important to note that this method has its limitations. It primarily works on older Android devices, specifically those running Android 5.0 (Lollipop) and below. As smartphone technology has evolved, manufacturers have patched many loopholes to enhance security. So, this method might not work for you if you have a more recent Android version.

But don’t worry – if you’re locked out of a newer phone, you can try several other methods, which you will explore later in this article. Remember, the **emergency call bypass** can be a lifesaver in specific scenarios. However, it’s always best to use such methods responsibly and ethically. And, of course, you should always note your passwords.

## Part 2: How To Perform Emergency Call Bypass To Unlock Screen

Unlocking your Android phone without a password using the Emergency Call Bypass method can be tricky, but it’s doable, especially on devices running Android OS 5.0 (Lollipop) and below. Here’s a step-by-step guide on **how to unlock any phone password using the emergency call** feature:

- **Step 1:** Start by tapping the **Emergency Call** button on your lock screen. This will bring up the emergency dialer screen.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![android tap to add emergency contacts](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/unlock-emergency-call-phone-03.jpg)

- **Step 2:** Type a series of special symbols on the dialer screen, such as asterisks (\*). Do this several times in a row.
- **Step 3:** Double-tap the string of symbols to highlight them, then copy the string. Now, tap on the screen to paste the copied string. Repeat this process 10 to 11 times until you can no longer highlight the series.
- **Step 4:** Go back to the lock screen. Open the **Camera** app by tapping the camera icon or sliding left. Simultaneously, pull down the Notification Panel from the top.
- **Step 5:** In the Notification Panel, tap the gear icon to try and access your device’s settings.
- **Step 6:** When prompted for a password, long-press and paste the copied string into the password field. Repeat this several times until the option to paste is no longer available.
- **Step 7:** Keep pasting the string until the interface crashes. The lock screen should disappear, and the camera interface will expand. After some time, the camera app should also crash, and your device will unlock, displaying the home screen.

![android home screen](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/unlock-emergency-call-phone-04.jpg)

This method, while unconventional, has been known to work on various Android 5 devices, including Samsung models. However, using this technique responsibly and only on devices you own or have permission to access is important. Remember, this method exploits a security flaw and should be used as a last resort.

## Part 3: Other Ways To Unlock Your Screen

While the **emergency call bypass for Android** method is interesting, it’s largely unreliable and outdated, mainly effective on older Android versions. Modern devices have significantly improved security, making this method obsolete. There are other, more reliable methods for those needing to unlock their phone’s screen.
