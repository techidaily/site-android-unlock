### Using Google Account Details

Almost all Android smartphones, including Huawei Nova Y71 , require you to enter your Google account details when setting up your phone for the first time. This account comes in handy later on in situations where your phone is lost or stolen or if you’re switching to another phone. However, it can also help with basic issues like unlocking your phone in case you forget your Huawei Nova Y71  screen unlock PIN, pattern, or password. But to use this method successfully, you need to remember the email address bound to the Huawei Nova Y71 device and its password.

So, if you still want to unlock Huawei Nova Y71  phone using this method, only do so if you have backed up your device and have no other way to unlock your phone.

## How to Remove Operator Lock on Huawei Nova Y71 ?

An operator lock, also called a carrier lock, constitutes a limitation imposed on a mobile phone by a network provider. This measure is implemented to guarantee that the Huawei Nova Y71 device exclusively functions with the services provided by that specific carrier. If you wish to remove the operator lock from your Huawei Nova Y71  device, you'll need to follow specific steps and meet certain criteria. Here's how to remove the operator lock on a Huawei Nova Y71 :

**Step 1:** Begin by checking whether your device can be unlocked or not from its network carrier restrictions. To do that, you need to dial the code “\*#\*#7378423#\*#\*” on your device, tap “Service Info” and select “SIM Lock.”

![dial the provided number](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/10/unlock-sony-xperia-pin-code-5.jpg)

**Step 2:** Carefully check the information provided on the screen. If there is "X" before the "Network" option and the number in front of it is larger than 0, it means your device can be unlocked. If the number in front of "Network" is 0, your device can't be unlocked as it is hard-locked.
