### 1\. Google Find My Device (For Android7.1.1 or later)

**Step 1.** Open the Android Device Manager site by typing [https://www.google.com/android/find](https://www.google.com/android/find) in an internet browser.

**Step 2.** You must give your Google ID credentials to sign in. Remember that this should be a similar Google account connected to your phone.

![find my device](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/tips-for-pattern-lock-1.jpg)

**Step 5.** Click on the "Lock" button to reset its pattern.

**Step 2.** On a similar window, click the "Forgot pattern" choice on the base.

**Step 3.** That will open another screen, which you can use to sidestep the forgotten pattern of Android. Select the choice for entering the Google Account credentials and continue.

![google account](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/tips-for-pattern-lock-2.jpg)

![draw unlock pattern](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/tips-for-pattern-lock-3.jpg)

![reboot to safe mode](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/tips-for-pattern-lock-4.jpg)
