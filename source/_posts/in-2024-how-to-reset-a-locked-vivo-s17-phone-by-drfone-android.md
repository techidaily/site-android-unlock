## Method 1: Unlock Vivo S17  Phones Running Older Android OS (4.4 Or Below) With Google Security Questions

Up until Android version 4.4, you could lock your phone screen with a pattern. Google allowed you to unlock the phone by answering security questions in case you forgot the pattern. Since these may also be easily guessed by people who are in possession of your device illegally, Google deprecated this method after Android 4.4. However, the phones running Android 4.4 or lower are still allowed to be unlocked using this method. So, if you have an old Vivo S17  with Android 4.4 or earlier, here is **how to unlock Vivo S17  phone password without factory reset**:

**Step 1:** You may already have entered the incorrect pattern a few times. If so, simply tap the Forgot Pattern to start the process of unlocking your Vivo S17  phone screen. Else, deliberately enter incorrect pattern a few times till you see the Forgot Pattern option:

**Step 3:** Sign into the Google account that matches with the Google account on the phone.

**Step 4:** Lastly, create a new pattern to unlock your Vivo S17  phone.

### Side Tip

It makes sense given that our phones hold a substantially large part of our personal and professional lives these days. And we are not even talking about features that you may or may not need - we are talking only from a data security point of view. Of course, you will also benefit from the massive performance improvements that have taken place thanks to hardware and software improvements over the years.

## Method 3: Factory Reset Vivo S17  Phones (Wipes User Data)

There is a standard factory reset built into every Vivo S17  phone to allow users to erase the Vivo S17 device and start over fully. This option wipes all user data and resets the phone to how you received it in the box. Naturally, this is not a preferred way, as it requires the phone to be set up all over again and that takes time. Also, all data will need to be backed up beforehand in order to restore it again. Overall, this method consumes a lot of time.

**Step 1:** Go to Settings > Backup & Reset.

**Step 2:** Tap Factory Reset > Reset Phone.

**Step 3:** Tap Erase Everything.

## Method 4: Use Google Find My Device To Unlock Vivo S17  Phones (Wipes User Data)

Google Find My Device is an online service by Google that is used to locate and track your Android devices. It works like how Apple's Find My works for its range of hardware. Using Find My Device, you can play a sound on the Vivo S17 device to locate it in the house if you have misplaced it, lock the phone in case it is lost, and wipe the Vivo S17 device remotely.

**Step 1:** Go to <https://accounts.google.com>.

**Step 2:** Log in and go to Security > Your Devices:

![unlock motorola phone with google](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/09/full-guide-to-unlock-motorola-phones-10.jpg)

**Step 3:** Click Find A Lost Device.

**Step 4:** Select the Android device you want to wipe carefully if you have a few:

![erase phone with google](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/09/full-guide-to-unlock-motorola-phones-11.jpg)

**Step 5:** Click Erase Device and confirm.

**Step 6:** After the erasure, your device will need to be set up all over again.

## Method 5: Request Service Provider To Unlock Your Vivo S17  Phone

If your Vivo S17  phone is tied to a service contract and you want to unlock your device to use it with other service providers, this method is for you. You can request your service provider to unlock your Vivo S17  phone provided their conditions are met. Usually, they will be happy to oblige if there are no dues and the service period is over.

## Bonus Tip: If You Want To Disable Screen Lock

Sometimes, you may not need to secure your device at all. For example, if you have an old device that you want to use as a media player in your car or to give to children to play games, you may not want to password-protect the Vivo S17 device. This is how to disable screen lock on Android:

**Step 1:** Navigate to Settings > Security > Screen Lock.

**Step 2:** Enter the PIN or pattern.

**Step 3:** Choose None and confirm.

### Conclusion

There are a handful of methods you can use to unlock a Vivo S17  phone in case you forget the password or PIN or pattern. Especially for the old pattern-based screen locks, it is easy to unlock the phone if you know the answers to the security questions in your Google account. However, to unlock Vivo S17  phone screen without password on newer Android versions, you need technical knowledge, or you can use third-party software such as Wondershare Dr.Fone. Using Dr.Fone Screen Unlock, you can unlock your phone quickly with no technical mumbo jumbo to confuse you. All you will get is a software that guides you every step of the way so you can unlock Vivo S17  phone easily.
