Setting up a PIN is straightforward via the Samsung Galaxy M14 5G device’s security settings, and unlocking your phone is as easy as tapping in the correct sequence of numbers.

You set it up in the security settings and use it to unlock your phone just like a PIN but with the added complexity of alphanumeric characters.
- **Face Unlock.Pixel’s Face Unlock** uses advanced facial recognition software. It scans your face to grant access, offering a hands-free and quick way to unlock your Pixel. This feature can be activated in the security settings and requires a simple glance at your phone to unlock.

### Method 2: Entering Into Safe Mode

Safe Mode is a diagnostic mode in Android that can help bypass third-party lock screen apps. It’s useful if you’ve used a third-party app for your lock screen.

Force resetting or flashing a new ROM can be considered a last resort. They involve erasing all data on your device or installing a new operating system.

- **Force resetting your device**. To force reset your Samsung, press and hold the Power and Volume Down buttons simultaneously to enter recovery mode. Use the volume buttons to navigate to **Wipe data/factory reset**and select it with the power button. This will get rid of existing password locks.
- **Flashing a new ROM**. This is more complex and typically requires downloading a new firmware and flashing tool. It’s only recommended for advanced users or as a last resort.

Remember, while these methods can effectively unlock your device, they also come with risks. Always [<u>back up your data regularly</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/backup/android-backup-software.html), and use these methods responsibly, considering their potential to erase your data or affect your device’s warranty.

## Part 2: Best Tool to Unlock Your Pattern

### Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock

The most effective and quick tool to unlock a **pattern lock** is Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock by Wondershare. Dr.Fone is an all-in-one tool for all your Android needs and has been in the business for a long time. We suggest you use Dr.Fone. The following steps will help you unlock your device:

**Step 1.** Select the "Screen Unlock" option in the Dr.Fone interface.

![screen unlock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png)

**Step 2. Select Unlock Android Screen**

To unlock the pattern lock on your device, the “Unlock Android Screen” will guide you to finish the whole process.

**Step 3. Select unlock mode**

If you click “Remove without Data Loss,” only some limited Samsung or LG phone models can be unlocked without losing data. To unlock most phone brands' screens, “100% Remove Screen Lock” is a better choice.
