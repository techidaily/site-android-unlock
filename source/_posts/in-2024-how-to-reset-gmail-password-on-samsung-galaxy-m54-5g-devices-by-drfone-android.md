One way to unlock your Android phone without losing the data is by utilizing Safe Mode. This method works only if the screen lock you have been using is a third-party app. Since Safe Mode disables third-party apps, you can easily use it to uninstall the problematic app. Here is **how to unlock an Android phone without losing data**:

**Step 1:** On your Android device, press and hold âPowerâ and âVolume Downâ keys together for 3 seconds. After the Power menu becomes visible, press and hold the âPower offâ option.

**Step 2:** After a while, you will see the "Safe Mode" option on your screen with some basic instructions. Now, you can use the button to boot into Safe Mode and remove the screen lock application.

## Part 6. How to Unlock Android Phone without Any Data Loss Using Google Account (Android 4.4 or lower)

If luckily, you left your Wi-Fi open and luckily connected to the internet, this is the easiest way to unlock your Android phone.

**The step-by-step guide for you to refer**

**Step 1:** Retry the incorrect password or pattern until the ''Forgotten Password/Pattern'' appears below. Then select that.

**Step 2:** Check ''Enter your Google Account details'' then tap next.

You will be given the option to input a new password or pattern right after you enter your Google account details. But if not, Google must have emailed you your temporary password or pattern that you will input to unlock your lock screen.
