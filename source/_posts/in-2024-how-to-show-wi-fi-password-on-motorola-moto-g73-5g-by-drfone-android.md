## How to Show Wi-Fi Password on Motorola Moto G73 5G

Since the invention of Android OS in 2008 by Andy Rubin, our world has faced a dramatic change. Android seems to be controlling a considerably high portion of our life. We have bought many gadgets that use this amazing OS and most of which are phones. But how much can you do with your Android phone? Developers are always making it more interesting to use this interface.

Most of the time, we use Android phones, we get faced with the need to access the internet. The Wi-Fi capability of these Android gadgets makes it super easy for us to surf the web. Throughout using Wi-Fi, we connect to a number of them. This could be at school, a sub-way café, the gym, buses, hospitals, hotels, towns, and the list is endless. A password secures most of this. Needless to say, our brain is weak to store all these passwords for future use, especially if you would want to connect with a different gadget you have recently bought or even your laptop. In this article, we will introduce you to how to find wifi password on rooted and also unrooted Android devices.

## Part 1: Show Wifi Password on Rooted Android Device

### What is Rooting?

First of all, what does rooting mean? You have probably used a Windows computer or even Linux. For the case of Windows, when installing a new program or software, it always prompts a dialog box saying, "Administrator permission required to run this program." If you don't have the administrator permission, you won't install the program. In Android, this is called rooting. In simple terms, it means having the root permission to your phone. Some Android apps will require you the root permission, e.g., flashing your ROM. In this part, we will explain how you can show the Wi-Fi password on your Android with root.

To find the Wi-Fi passwords on your Android phone, you need to have an app to explore files which also supports a root user. In this case, ES FileExplorer or Root Explorer will come in handy. However, it turns out that the latter is offered at $3. Let's use the free ES File Explorer.

### Steps of getting Wi-Fi password on Android with root

In only four steps, we, at this moment, learn how we can find the password of a Wi-Fi on an Android phone.

Step 1: Install the ES File Explorer

Download the ES File Explorer from your play store, install it, and open it.

![android show wifi password](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14556286507084.jpg)

Step 2: Enable Root Explorer

The root explorer needs to be enabled so that you can reach the root folders of the Wi-Fi passwords you need. By default, the root feature in this ES explorer is not enabled. To enable it, just tap on the list menu on the top left corner.:

![android show wifi password](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14556292611536.jpg)

This will drop down a list of controls. Scroll down and find the **Root Explorer** option and enable it.

![android show wifi password](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14556293052566.jpg)

Step 3: Get the passwords' file.

Go back to ES file explorer, and this time, find the folder named **data**.

![android show wifi password](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14556293412707.jpg)

When this folder opens, find another one named **misc**. Open it and find another one named **wifi**. Here, find a file named **wpa\_supplicant.conf**.

![android show wifi password](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14556293762552.jpg)

Step 4: Retrieve the wifi password on Android

Make sure that you don't edit anything in the file. You might mess up with important data and fail to access the Wi-Fi(s) in the future.

![android show wifi password](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14556294042257.jpg)

As you can see above, we have found the Wi-Fi passwords on the android device. On each network profile, we have the name of the network represented by _name (ssid="{the name}")_, the network's password represented by _psk_, the network's access point represented by _key\_mgmt=WPA-PSK_ and its priority represented by _priority_.

## Part 2: Show Wifi Password on Android without Root

What if I don't have root access to my Android, can I still see Android Wi-Fi password? The short answer is yes. However, this is a bit involving but simple. You don't need to be a computer guru to do it, but you need to have a computer and some internet access of course. The key thing is to find a way through which we can fetch the password file from the phone without using a root access protocol in the Android. This is made possible by some little programming insight using the Windows Command prompt.

### Steps to show Wi-Fi password on Android without root

Step 1: Access the Developer authority

To access the files that Android uses to run passwords, you must first become a developer. This is very simple.

Get your Android phone and go to settings. Scroll down and find "About phone." Tap on it and scroll down again to find Build number.

![android show wifi password](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14556302638925.jpg)

Tap on this "build number" 5 to 6 times until a message pops up, saying, "You are now a developer".

![android show wifi password](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14556303263992.jpg)

Step 2: Enable the debugging.

Go back to Settings. Scroll down for developer options. Turn on the button for "Android/USB debugging".

![android show wifi password](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14556308665697.jpg)

Step 3: Install ADB drivers.

Now, open your Windows desktop. Download and install ADB drivers. (Use this download link [adbdriver.com](http://adbdriver.com/)). You need to download and install platform tools (minimal ADB and fastboot) from [http://forum.xda-developers.com/...](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2317790) Now open the folder where you've installed the above tools. By default, it is in the Local disc _C\\windows\\system32\\platform\_tools_ location. However, you might want to locate them by searching on the windows search engine. You have to hold the Shift key and right-click inside the folder to click on"Open Command Window Here."

![android show wifi password](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14556329561742.jpg)

Step 4: Test the ADB

Here, we would like to test whether the ABD is working properly. To do this, connect your phone to the PC using a USB. In the command prompt, type **adb services** and then press enter. If it's working properly, you should see a device on this list.

![android show wifi password](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14556329984622.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
Step 5: Find the Android wifi password.

Now, it is time to type the given command in the command prompt and type: _adb pull /data/misc/wifi/wpa\_supplicant.conf c:/wpa\_supplicant.conf_. This will fetch the file from your phone to the local disc C drive of the PC.

Step 6: Get the wifi passwords.

Lastly, open the file with a notepad, and there you go.

![android show wifi password](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14556331232772.jpg)

Now you learned how to show the wifi password on your Android device.

## Part 1: Ways That Motorola Lets You Unlock Your Motorola Moto G73 5G

Motorola Moto G73 5G  are more than just smartphones; they are gateways to a personalized and secure user experience. To access the myriad of features these devices offer, Google provides several unlocking methods, ensuring both convenience and security. Here are these options:

- A Personal Identification Number (PIN) is a simple yet effective way to secure your phone. It’s a numeric code that you enter on the lock screen. Setting up a PIN is straightforward via the Motorola Moto G73 5G device’s security settings, and unlocking your phone is as easy as tapping in the correct sequence of numbers.
- Similar to a PIN but potentially more secure due to the allowance of a longer combination of numbers and letters. A passcode is ideal for those who seek an extra layer of security. You set it up in the security settings and use it to unlock your phone just like a PIN but with the added complexity of alphanumeric characters.
- **Face Unlock.Pixel’s Face Unlock** uses advanced facial recognition software. It scans your face to grant access, offering a hands-free and quick way to unlock your Pixel. This feature can be activated in the security settings and requires a simple glance at your phone to unlock.

![woman holding a Motorola Moto G73 5G  ](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/google-pixel-7-unlock-02.jpg)

- [**<u><b>Fingerprint Unlock</b></u>**](https://drfone.wondershare.com/google-frp-unlock/google-pixel-frp-bypass.html)**.** This method uses your unique fingerprint as a key. It’s fast, secure, and convenient. The Pixel 6a, 6, and 7 fingerprint scanners are actually under the display. Register your fingerprint in the settings, then touch the sensor to gain access.
- **Pattern**. If you prefer a more visual method, the [<u>pattern lock</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/mi-pattern-lock.html)lets you draw a specific shape or pattern on the screen to unlock your phone. It’s a fun and interactive way to secure your device. Create your pattern in the security settings, and unlock your phone by replicating it on the lock screen.

In essence, each unlocking method offered by the Motorola Moto G73 5G  provides a blend of security and ease. Whichever unlocking method you prefer, Google ensures that accessing your phone is secure and convenient. All you need to do is set up your preferred method in the Motorola Moto G73 5G device’s settings and use it to unlock your phone.

### Method 2: Entering Into Safe Mode

Safe Mode is a diagnostic mode in Android that can help bypass third-party lock screen apps. It’s useful if you’ve used a third-party app for your lock screen.

To do this, press the power button, then long-press on the **Power off** option. Tap **OK** when **Reboot to safe mode** option appears. In Safe Mode, third-party apps are disabled. Thus, you can now access your device if a third-party app is causing lock issues.

Force resetting or flashing a new ROM can be considered a last resort. They involve erasing all data on your device or installing a new operating system.

- **Force resetting your device**. To force reset your Motorola, press and hold the Power and Volume Down buttons simultaneously to enter recovery mode. Use the volume buttons to navigate to **Wipe data/factory reset**and select it with the power button. This will get rid of existing password locks.
- **Flashing a new ROM**. This is more complex and typically requires downloading a new firmware and flashing tool. It’s only recommended for advanced users or as a last resort.

Remember, while these methods can effectively unlock your device, they also come with risks. Always [<u>back up your data regularly</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/backup/android-backup-software.html), and use these methods responsibly, considering their potential to erase your data or affect your device’s warranty.
