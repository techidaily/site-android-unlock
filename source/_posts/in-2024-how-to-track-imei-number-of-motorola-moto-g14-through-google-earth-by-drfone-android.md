## Part 1: How To Track Your Motorola Moto G14 on Google Earth

This **Google Maps IMEI number tracking** issue has caused quite a buzz and controversy on the internet. It has raised many concerns regarding the safety and privacy of every smartphone user. To tell you the truth, Google Earth lacks IMEI location data and does not provide such capabilities. Thus, there is no truth in **tracking IMEI numbers through Google Earth**.

However, if you have access to a cell phone's GPS coordinates or the location of a cell tower to which it is linked, you can use Google Earth to follow its location.

### How To Locate a Smartphone Using Google Earth

Many current smartphones include GPS receivers that allow them to pinpoint their exact location. If you know the phone's GPS coordinates, you can plug them into Google Earth to see where it is on the map.

- **Step 1:** This process won't be possible if your location services are not enabled on your phone. To do this, navigate to **Settings,** then **Location** on Android, and **Settings** > **Privacy** > **Location Services** on iOS.

![iphone location services](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/09/track-imei-number-through-google-earth-02.jpg)

- **Step 2:** Google Earth can be downloaded and installed on your computer or mobile device. It works with Windows, macOS, Android, and iOS. Download it from your device's **Google Earth** website or the app store.

- **Step 3:** Sign in to Google Earth using the Google Account linked to the phone you want to track. This step is required to acquire location data and [monitor IMEI numbers](https://drfone.wondershare.com/android-unlock/check-imei-number-location.html) using Google Earth.
- **Step 4:** Launch Google Earth on your computer or mobile device, then select **Your timeline** from the Google Maps menu. The operation will take you to the Google Maps Timeline page.
