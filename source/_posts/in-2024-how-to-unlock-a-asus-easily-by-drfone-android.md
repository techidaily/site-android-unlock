#### Problem

The problem may lie with your fingers rather than the Asus ROG Phone 8 device. Unclean or moist fingers can hinder accurate fingerprint recognition on the sensor, causing **the Asus ROG Phone 8 fingerprint sensor to not work**.

#### Solution

##### 1\. Cleanse and Dry Your Hands

Remove any dirt, oil, or moisture that might cause issues with the fingerprint sensor. It's crucial to wash and thoroughly dry your hands.
