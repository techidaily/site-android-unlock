## Part 1: Remove Previously Synced Google Account from Android Phone Without Phone Reset

In this part, we will discuss the methods that can be used for removing the previously synced account from your Android phone without a phone reset.

### Method 1: Removing Google Account using the Android Settings Menu

If you just plan to reset your phone, maybe because of the lag caused by the phone cache, and you know the inconvenience of Google FRP as a protection mechanism, then you can remove Google FRP through the Settings menu.

The steps for this method are listed below.

- **Step 1:** On your Android phone go to the Settings option and choose Accounts & Backup.
- **Step 2:** Select the Manage Accounts option now and the list of the associated Google Devices will appear.
- **Step 3:** Choose and click on the Google Account that you want to remove and a pop-up message will appear to inform you that all the account data will be deleted with this action.

To confirm the removal of the account, click on the Remove account button.

### Method 2: Remove the Google account from the Android phone using the computer

There is another method using which you can remotely remove the Google account associated with your phone. The steps for the method are listed below.

- **Step 1:** Using another device or a PC, sign in to your Google account that was previously synced on this device and choose the Security option.
- **Step 2:** Next scroll down and then tap on the Your devices option and choose to Manage devices.
- **Step 3:** You will now see the list of devices linked to your Google account. Next, tap on Find a lost or stolen phone and then select the Remove option present next to Account access.
- **Step 4:** You will be again asked if you want to delete the account. Select the Remove option.
- **Step 5:** The account will be removed successfully and the confirmation message will appear.

**Note:** This method will actually sign out you from the Google account and will not delete it permanently. To again get access to the account, a notification will appear on your phone to enter the password.

![bypass-frp-unlockjunkey](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/06/unlockjunky.jpg)

**Limitations of using the Unlockjunky method**:

- This is a paid service.
- Works only with Motorola, ZTE, and Samsung devices.
- There is no surety that the service will work for removing the FRP lock on your devices.
- If you have to remove the FRP lock from multiple devices, a separate payment for each device has to be done.
