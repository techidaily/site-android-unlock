## How to Unlock a Network Locked Lenovo ThinkPhone Phone?

Revolutions in the telecommunication industry have introduced advancements in smartphone features and utilities. The other side of the coin is, however, not as appealing. Thanks to the different carrier services, network locking is the commonest issue of recent mobile launches. Users have reported of Lenovo ThinkPhone phones refusing to work with different carriers.

The issue limits the smartphone's functioning to the specific carrier from whom the Lenovo ThinkPhone device is purchased. Consequently, there are annoying connectivity problems that restrict seamless mobile usage. The problem aggravates in geo-restricted regions where the carrier options are quite limited. This scenario puts forward the need for **Lenovo ThinkPhone network unlock** solutions.

## Part 1: What Does It Mean When Your Lenovo ThinkPhone Phone is Network Locked?

In the simplest words, a network-locked Lenovo ThinkPhone phone means that your device has become carrier-specific. It will now work only with the network provider from where the phone was purchased. Another problem is that there is no automatic unlocking even after the expiry of your contract with the carrier service. Having a network-locked Lenovo ThinkPhone phone poses undesired connectivity issues.

### 1\. Why is my phone locked to the network carrier?

Smartphones are network locked by carrier services to prevent customers from switching to a different carrier. Reasons for switching can be the availability of better plans, discounts, etc. Another cause of locking the phones to specific carriers is preventing them from theft and unauthorized usage.
