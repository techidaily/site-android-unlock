## How to Unlock a Network Locked Meizu 21 Pro Phone?

Revolutions in the telecommunication industry have introduced advancements in smartphone features and utilities. The other side of the coin is, however, not as appealing. Thanks to the different carrier services, network locking is the commonest issue of recent mobile launches. Users have reported of Meizu 21 Pro phones refusing to work with different carriers.

The issue limits the smartphone's functioning to the specific carrier from whom the Meizu 21 Pro device is purchased. Consequently, there are annoying connectivity problems that restrict seamless mobile usage. The problem aggravates in geo-restricted regions where the carrier options are quite limited. This scenario puts forward the need for **Meizu 21 Pro network unlock** solutions.

## Part 1: What Does It Mean When Your Meizu 21 Pro Phone is Network Locked?

In the simplest words, a network-locked Meizu 21 Pro phone means that your device has become carrier-specific. It will now work only with the network provider from where the phone was purchased. Another problem is that there is no automatic unlocking even after the expiry of your contract with the carrier service. Having a network-locked Meizu 21 Pro phone poses undesired connectivity issues.

### 1\. Why is my phone locked to the network carrier?

Smartphones are network locked by carrier services to prevent customers from switching to a different carrier. Reasons for switching can be the availability of better plans, discounts, etc. Another cause of locking the phones to specific carriers is preventing them from theft and unauthorized usage.

### 2\. Is it legal to unlock it?

Unlocking your network-locked phone is legal in every sense. It is however advisable to contact your service provider for addressing the concern. The only downside of unlocking such phones is the loss of device warranty assured at the time of purchase.

### Using Google Account Details

Almost all Android smartphones, including Meizu 21 Pro , require you to enter your Google account details when setting up your phone for the first time. This account comes in handy later on in situations where your phone is lost or stolen or if you’re switching to another phone. However, it can also help with basic issues like unlocking your phone in case you forget your Meizu 21 Pro  screen unlock PIN, pattern, or password. But to use this method successfully, you need to remember the email address bound to the Meizu 21 Pro device and its password.

Here's how to unlock the Meizu 21 Pro  pattern lock without losing data using your Google account:

- **Step 1:** Enter the incorrect PIN, pattern, or password 5 times, and click on “Forgot Password” or “Forgot Pattern.”
- **Step 2:** The interface will then ask you to enter your Google account details as an alternate option. Enter the Google account details you used when setting up your Meizu 21 Pro  phone.
- **Step 3:** This will unlock your phone. You can now reset the screen unlock PIN, password, or pattern.

If you don't remember your Google account details, you can still unlock your Meizu 21 Pro  phone using a third-party tool.

## How to Unlock Meizu 21 Pro  by Hard Reset?

Hard resetting your smartphone usually solves everything! Hence, it can also help you unlock your Meizu 21 Pro  phone; however, using this method will erase all the data on your phone. So, if you still want to unlock Meizu 21 Pro  phone using this method, only do so if you have backed up your device and have no other way to unlock your phone. This includes forgetting your Google account details or not having access to a PC to download and use Dr Fone - Screen Unlock (Android).

## How to Remove Operator Lock on Meizu 21 Pro ?

An operator lock, also called a carrier lock, constitutes a limitation imposed on a mobile phone by a network provider. This measure is implemented to guarantee that the Meizu 21 Pro device exclusively functions with the services provided by that specific carrier. If you wish to remove the operator lock from your Meizu 21 Pro  device, you'll need to follow specific steps and meet certain criteria. Here's how to remove the operator lock on a Meizu 21 Pro :

**Step 1:** Begin by checking whether your device can be unlocked or not from its network carrier restrictions. To do that, you need to dial the code “\*#\*#7378423#\*#\*” on your device, tap “Service Info” and select “SIM Lock.”

![dial the provided number](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/10/unlock-sony-xperia-pin-code-5.jpg)

**Step 2:** Carefully check the information provided on the screen. If there is "X" before the "Network" option and the number in front of it is larger than 0, it means your device can be unlocked. If the number in front of "Network" is 0, your device can't be unlocked as it is hard-locked.
