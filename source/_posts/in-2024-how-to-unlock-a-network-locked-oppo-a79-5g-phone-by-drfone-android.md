## How to Unlock a Network Locked Oppo A79 5G Phone?

Revolutions in the telecommunication industry have introduced advancements in smartphone features and utilities. The other side of the coin is, however, not as appealing. Thanks to the different carrier services, network locking is the commonest issue of recent mobile launches. Users have reported of Oppo A79 5G phones refusing to work with different carriers.

The issue limits the smartphone's functioning to the specific carrier from whom the Oppo A79 5G device is purchased. Consequently, there are annoying connectivity problems that restrict seamless mobile usage. The problem aggravates in geo-restricted regions where the carrier options are quite limited. This scenario puts forward the need for **Oppo A79 5G network unlock** solutions.

## Part 1: What Does It Mean When Your Oppo A79 5G Phone is Network Locked?

In the simplest words, a network-locked Oppo A79 5G phone means that your device has become carrier-specific. It will now work only with the network provider from where the phone was purchased. Another problem is that there is no automatic unlocking even after the expiry of your contract with the carrier service. Having a network-locked Oppo A79 5G phone poses undesired connectivity issues.

### 1\. Why is my phone locked to the network carrier?

Smartphones are network locked by carrier services to prevent customers from switching to a different carrier. Reasons for switching can be the availability of better plans, discounts, etc. Another cause of locking the phones to specific carriers is preventing them from theft and unauthorized usage.

### 2\. Is it legal to unlock it?

Unlocking your network-locked phone is legal in every sense. It is however advisable to contact your service provider for addressing the concern. The only downside of unlocking such phones is the loss of device warranty assured at the time of purchase.

But you have to face it: sometimes, people forget the codes they set to protect their phones or can’t unlock them with their injured fingers or faces. Picture this: you’re staring at your phone screen, trying to recall that password, but it’s not coming to you.

That’s where emergency call bypass is a nifty little trick that can be a lifesaver. In this article, you’ll learn **how to unlock any phone password using the emergency call** technique. The article will also explore other methods for when your memory fails you. So, read through and never go through this trouble again.

## Part 1: What Is the Emergency Call Bypass Method?

The **Android emergency call bypass** method is a lesser-known workaround for those unfortunate moments when you’re locked out of your phone. This method exploits a loophole in the phone’s lock screen, allowing you to access your device even when you’ve [<u>forgotten your password, PIN, or pattern</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/9-ways-to-bypass-samsung-lock-screen-pattern-pin-password-fingerprint.html). It’s like finding a secret backdoor when the front door is bolted shut.

**“How can unlocking Vivo, Oppo, and Samsung phones using emergency calls** be effective?” You may ask. Imagine you need to access important information on your phone but can’t remember your lock screen code. Instead of panicking or rushing to a technician, the emergency call bypass can be a quick and handy solution. It’s particularly useful when immediate access to your phone is crucial and you don’t have time to [<u>reset your password </u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/reset-android/how-to-reset-privacy-password-in-oppo.html) through official channels.

### Limitations of the Emergency Call Bypass Method

However, it’s important to note that this method has its limitations. It primarily works on older Android devices, specifically those running Android 5.0 (Lollipop) and below. As smartphone technology has evolved, manufacturers have patched many loopholes to enhance security. So, this method might not work for you if you have a more recent Android version.

But don’t worry – if you’re locked out of a newer phone, you can try several other methods, which you will explore later in this article. Remember, the **emergency call bypass** can be a lifesaver in specific scenarios. However, it’s always best to use such methods responsibly and ethically. And, of course, you should always note your passwords.

## Part 2: How To Perform Emergency Call Bypass To Unlock Screen

Unlocking your Android phone without a password using the Emergency Call Bypass method can be tricky, but it’s doable, especially on devices running Android OS 5.0 (Lollipop) and below. Here’s a step-by-step guide on **how to unlock any phone password using the emergency call** feature:

- **Step 1:** Start by tapping the **Emergency Call** button on your lock screen. This will bring up the emergency dialer screen.

![android tap to add emergency contacts](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/unlock-emergency-call-phone-03.jpg)

- **Step 2:** Type a series of special symbols on the dialer screen, such as asterisks (\*). Do this several times in a row.
- **Step 3:** Double-tap the string of symbols to highlight them, then copy the string. Now, tap on the screen to paste the copied string. Repeat this process 10 to 11 times until you can no longer highlight the series.
- **Step 4:** Go back to the lock screen. Open the **Camera** app by tapping the camera icon or sliding left. Simultaneously, pull down the Notification Panel from the top.
- **Step 5:** In the Notification Panel, tap the gear icon to try and access your device’s settings.
- **Step 6:** When prompted for a password, long-press and paste the copied string into the password field. Repeat this several times until the option to paste is no longer available.
- **Step 7:** Keep pasting the string until the interface crashes. The lock screen should disappear, and the camera interface will expand. After some time, the camera app should also crash, and your device will unlock, displaying the home screen.

![android home screen](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/unlock-emergency-call-phone-04.jpg)

This method, while unconventional, has been known to work on various Android 5 devices, including Samsung models. However, using this technique responsibly and only on devices you own or have permission to access is important. Remember, this method exploits a security flaw and should be used as a last resort.

## Part 3: Other Ways To Unlock Your Screen

While the **emergency call bypass for Android** method is interesting, it’s largely unreliable and outdated, mainly effective on older Android versions. Modern devices have significantly improved security, making this method obsolete. There are other, more reliable methods for those needing to unlock their phone’s screen.

### Method 2: Using “Forgot PIN/Passcode” and Google Account

You can use the **Forgot PIN/Passcode** feature if you’ve linked your phone to a Google account. After multiple failed attempts to unlock your phone, you’ll see a prompt to reset the password via your Google account credentials.

### Method 3: Forcing a Data Reset on Your Android Phone

As a last resort, you can [<u>perform a factory reset</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/reset-android/how-to-factory-reset-huawei-phone-when-locked.html). This will erase all data on your device but remove the lock screen. Access the recovery mode by pressing a combination of keys (usually volume up/down and the power button) and then selecting **Wipe data/Factory reset**.

### Method 4: Booting Into Safe Mode

Booting into safe mode can bypass third-party lock screens. This method won’t work on the default lock screen but can be helpful if an app sets the lock.

In summary, while the emergency call bypass is a thing of the past, there are still various ways to unlock your phone. There’s always a solution, whether through a sophisticated tool like Wondershare Dr.Fone or built-in Android features.
