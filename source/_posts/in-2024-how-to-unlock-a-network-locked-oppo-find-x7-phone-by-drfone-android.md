## How to Unlock a Network Locked Oppo Find X7 Phone?

Revolutions in the telecommunication industry have introduced advancements in smartphone features and utilities. The other side of the coin is, however, not as appealing. Thanks to the different carrier services, network locking is the commonest issue of recent mobile launches. Users have reported of Oppo Find X7 phones refusing to work with different carriers.

The issue limits the smartphone's functioning to the specific carrier from whom the Oppo Find X7 device is purchased. Consequently, there are annoying connectivity problems that restrict seamless mobile usage. The problem aggravates in geo-restricted regions where the carrier options are quite limited. This scenario puts forward the need for **Oppo Find X7 network unlock** solutions.

## Part 1: What Does It Mean When Your Oppo Find X7 Phone is Network Locked?

In the simplest words, a network-locked Oppo Find X7 phone means that your device has become carrier-specific. It will now work only with the network provider from where the phone was purchased.

However, the process may seem a bit time-consuming to you. Here is how you can do it.

### Way 2: Boot into Safe Mode to Bypass Third-Party App Screen Lock

### Way 3: Unlock Pattern Lock via Factory Reset

Type the new password once, then confirm it by typing it again. This will change the password in a few minutes and the new password can be used to unlock the Oppo Find X7 device.

### Way 5: Use Forgot Pattern Feature \[Android 4.4 Version and Earlier\]

After a few failed attempts, the warning "Try again in 30 seconds" appears and here is where the steps begin. Let us get to know in detail.

**Step 1**: Simply enter wrong pattern too many times until try again in 30 seconds warning comes.
