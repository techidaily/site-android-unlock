## How to Unlock a Network Locked Samsung Galaxy A05s Phone?

Revolutions in the telecommunication industry have introduced advancements in smartphone features and utilities. The other side of the coin is, however, not as appealing. Thanks to the different carrier services, network locking is the commonest issue of recent mobile launches. Users have reported of Samsung Galaxy A05s phones refusing to work with different carriers.

The issue limits the smartphone's functioning to the specific carrier from whom the Samsung Galaxy A05s device is purchased. Consequently, there are annoying connectivity problems that restrict seamless mobile usage. The problem aggravates in geo-restricted regions where the carrier options are quite limited. This scenario puts forward the need for **Samsung Galaxy A05s network unlock** solutions.

## Part 1: What Does It Mean When Your Samsung Galaxy A05s Phone is Network Locked?

In the simplest words, a network-locked Samsung Galaxy A05s phone means that your device has become carrier-specific.

Unlocking your network-locked phone is legal in every sense. It is however advisable to contact your service provider for addressing the concern. The only downside of unlocking such phones is the loss of device warranty assured at the time of purchase.

**Step 1:** Initiating Safe Mode requires a simultaneous three-second press of the "Volume Down" and "Power" keys. When the power menu becomes visible, proceed to long-press the "Power Off" icon.

**Step 2:** In a moment, you'll see the option "Safe Mode" replacing the other "Power Off" menu options. Proceed to boot your device into Safe Mode and uninstall the troublesome application.
