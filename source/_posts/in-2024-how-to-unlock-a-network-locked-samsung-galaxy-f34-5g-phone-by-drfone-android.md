## Part 1: What Does It Mean When Your Samsung Galaxy F34 5G Phone is Network Locked?

In the simplest words, a network-locked Samsung Galaxy F34 5G phone means that your device has become carrier-specific. It will now work only with the network provider from where the phone was purchased. Another problem is that there is no automatic unlocking even after the expiry of your contract with the carrier service. Having a network-locked Samsung Galaxy F34 5G phone poses undesired connectivity issues.
