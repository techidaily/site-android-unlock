## How to Unlock a Network Locked Vivo Y78 5G Phone?

Revolutions in the telecommunication industry have introduced advancements in smartphone features and utilities. The other side of the coin is, however, not as appealing.

## Part 1: What Does It Mean When Your Vivo Y78 5G Phone is Network Locked?

In the simplest words, a network-locked Vivo Y78 5G phone means that your device has become carrier-specific. It will now work only with the network provider from where the phone was purchased.

### 2\. Is it legal to unlock it?

Unlocking your network-locked phone is legal in every sense. It is however advisable to contact your service provider for addressing the concern. The only downside of unlocking such phones is the loss of device warranty assured at the time of purchase.
