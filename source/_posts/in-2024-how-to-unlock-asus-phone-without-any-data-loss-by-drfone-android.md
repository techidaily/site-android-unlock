![Minimal adb and fastboot folder](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/06/14648313625020.jpg)

**Step 5.** Inside the folder, hold the Shift key on your keyboard, then right-click your mouse. An additional "Open command window here" will appear so select that.

**Step 6.** ADB terminal will pop out. Now, the first is to type in ADB _devices_. This is to check if your device is recognized by ADB. If there is no device listed below, try to remove and reconnect your Asus ROG Phone 8 and retype the command. If there are listed devices already, proceed.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

**Step 7.** Finally, type in the following commands **one by one****.** These commands will remove your lock screen.

- _adb shell_
- _cd /data/data/com.android.providers.settings/databases_
- _sqlite3 settings.db_
- _update system set value=0 where_
- _name='lock\_pattern\_autolock';_
- _update system set value=0 where_
- _name='lockscreen.lockedoutpermanently';_
- _.quit_

![Minimal adb and fastboot adb shell command](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/06/14648317729484.jpg)

This would work if you have your USB debugging turned on before it was locked. That's how to unlock Android using ADB.
