## How to Unlock Asus ROG Phone 8 Phone without Google Account?

Uh oh – you’ve forgotten your Android Unlock code, and you can’t get it online to unlock using Google. Nothing could be more frustrating than gazing at your phone, knowing that it is essentially a paperweight at this point. Unless you can get it unlocked, your phone is useless, and all of your important photos, text messages, and content are all locked out of your reach. While right now, nothing can do without a Google account. But you can try to reset your Google account first.

## Part 1: How to Bypass Lock Screen on Android device with Google Account (Android Device Manager)

Even if you have a Google account, if your phone isn’t connected to the internet, you cannot access it to unlock your phone. If this sounds familiar, you can always try this method.

1\. First, navigate to the Android Device Manager page. You will need to sign in with the Google account that you use to set up your phone.

Android Device Manager link: <http://www.google.com/android/devicemanager>

2\. Once you have logged in, you will automatically be redirected to the Android Device Manager page. If this is your first time, click the “Accept” button.

![android Device Manager start](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14637942473262.jpg)

3\. A list of all of the Asus ROG Phone 8 devices registered to this Android account will pop up. Select the Asus ROG Phone 8 device in question from this list.

![android Device Manager list of devices](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14637942503282.jpg)

4\. The Android Device Manager will then locate your device. Make sure it is turned on!

![android Device Manager locating device](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14637942532352.jpg)

5\. After it has been located, you will have a few options for what to do next. If you do not know your phone's location, you can call it from this screen, but if you know where it is, click the ‘Enable Lock & Erase’ option.

![android Device Manager device located](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14637942568385.jpg)

6\. A notification will pop up on your device; confirm it.

![android Device Manager Erase & Lock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14637942582896.jpg)

![android Device Manager New Lock Screen](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14637943377629.jpg)

8\. Now, simply enter the new passcode on your device, and voila! It will open, and you can get back to your daily routine.

## Part 2: How to Reset Your Google Account on your Android Phone

If you have forgotten your Google Account password, it is still possible to unlock your account and access the information within. Here is how you can unlock your Google account on your Android phone.

1\. On your browser, go to the Google home page and try to sign in. You will fail, but that is good! It will lead you to the next step.

![android Google web page](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14637535742329.jpg)

![android Google trouble signing in](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14637535788151.jpg)

4\. Two options will then appear: the first is your phone number, and the other asks you for your backup email.

5\. Enter either one of these options, and you will receive a verification code via email, SMS, or a telephone call from an operator. If you have chosen to enter your backup email, at this point, you will receive detailed instructions on how to access the ‘reset password’ page.
