## How to Unlock a Network Locked Asus ROG Phone 8 Phone?

Revolutions in the telecommunication industry have introduced advancements in smartphone features and utilities. The other side of the coin is, however, not as appealing. Thanks to the different carrier services, network locking is the commonest issue of recent mobile launches. Users have reported of Asus ROG Phone 8 phones refusing to work with different carriers.

The issue limits the smartphone's functioning to the specific carrier from whom the Asus ROG Phone 8 device is purchased.

This scenario puts forward the need for **Asus ROG Phone 8 network unlock** solutions.

## Part 1: What Does It Mean When Your Asus ROG Phone 8 Phone is Network Locked?

In the simplest words, a network-locked Asus ROG Phone 8 phone means that your device has become carrier-specific. It will now work only with the network provider from where the phone was purchased. Another problem is that there is no automatic unlocking even after the expiry of your contract with the carrier service. Having a network-locked Asus ROG Phone 8 phone poses undesired connectivity issues.

### 1\. Why is my phone locked to the network carrier?

Smartphones are network locked by carrier services to prevent customers from switching to a different carrier. Reasons for switching can be the availability of better plans, discounts, etc. Another cause of locking the phones to specific carriers is preventing them from theft and unauthorized usage.

### 2\. Is it legal to unlock it?

Unlocking your network-locked phone is legal in every sense. It is however advisable to contact your service provider for addressing the concern. The only downside of unlocking such phones is the loss of device warranty assured at the time of purchase.
