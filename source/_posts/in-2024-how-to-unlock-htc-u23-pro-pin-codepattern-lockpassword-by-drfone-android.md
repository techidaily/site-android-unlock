## How to Unlock HTC U23 Pro  with Google Account?

Almost all Android smartphones, including HTC U23 Pro , require you to enter your Google account details when setting up your phone for the first time. This includes the email, password, and security question. These details come in handy later on in situations where your phone is lost or stolen or if you’re switching to another phone. However, they can also help with basic issues like unlocking your phone in case you forget your HTC U23 Pro  screen unlock PIN, pattern, or password.

You can unlock your HTC U23 Pro  phone with Google Account in the following two ways:

Almost all Android smartphones, including HTC U23 Pro , require you to enter your Google account details when setting up your phone for the first time.

- **Step 1:** Enter the incorrect PIN, pattern, or password 5 times, and click on “Forgot Password” or “Forgot Pattern.”

So, if you still want to unlock HTC U23 Pro  phone using this method, only do so if you have backed up your device and have no other way to unlock your phone.
