## Part 6. How to Unlock Android Phone without Any Data Loss Using Google Account (Android 4.4 or lower)

If luckily, you left your Wi-Fi open and luckily connected to the internet, this is the easiest way to unlock your Android phone.

**The step-by-step guide for you to refer**

**Step 1:** Retry the incorrect password or pattern until the ''Forgotten Password/Pattern'' appears below. Then select that.

**Step 2:** Check ''Enter your Google Account details'' then tap next.

**Step 3:** Input your Google Account details, username, and password. You are done.

You will be given the option to input a new password or pattern right after you enter your Google account details. But if not, Google must have emailed you your temporary password or pattern that you will input to unlock your lock screen.
