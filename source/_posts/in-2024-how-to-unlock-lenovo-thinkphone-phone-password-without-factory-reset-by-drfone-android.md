## Method 1: Unlock Lenovo ThinkPhone  Phones Running Older Android OS (4.4 Or Below) With Google Security Questions

Up until Android version 4.4, you could lock your phone screen with a pattern. Google allowed you to unlock the phone by answering security questions in case you forgot the pattern. Since these may also be easily guessed by people who are in possession of your device illegally, Google deprecated this method after Android 4.4. However, the phones running Android 4.4 or lower are still allowed to be unlocked using this method. So, if you have an old Lenovo ThinkPhone  with Android 4.4 or earlier, here is **how to unlock Lenovo ThinkPhone  phone password without factory reset**:

**Step 1:** You may already have entered the incorrect pattern a few times. If so, simply tap the Forgot Pattern to start the process of unlocking your Lenovo ThinkPhone  phone screen. Else, deliberately enter incorrect pattern a few times till you see the Forgot Pattern option:

![unlock motorola phone with security questions](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/09/full-guide-to-unlock-motorola-phones-2.jpg)

**Step 2:** Next, choose the option to reset the pattern by answering your Google credentials.

**Step 3:** Sign into the Google account that matches with the Google account on the phone.

**Step 4:** Lastly, create a new pattern to unlock your Lenovo ThinkPhone  phone.

## Method 3: Factory Reset Lenovo ThinkPhone  Phones (Wipes User Data)

There is a standard factory reset built into every Lenovo ThinkPhone  phone to allow users to erase the Lenovo ThinkPhone device and start over fully. This option wipes all user data and resets the phone to how you received it in the box. Naturally, this is not a preferred way, as it requires the phone to be set up all over again and that takes time. Also, all data will need to be backed up beforehand in order to restore it again. Overall, this method consumes a lot of time.

**Step 1:** Go to Settings > Backup & Reset.

**Step 2:** Tap Factory Reset > Reset Phone.

**Step 3:** Tap Erase Everything.

## Method 4: Use Google Find My Device To Unlock Lenovo ThinkPhone  Phones (Wipes User Data)

Using Find My Device, you can play a sound on the Lenovo ThinkPhone device to locate it in the house if you have misplaced it, lock the phone in case it is lost, and wipe the Lenovo ThinkPhone device remotely.

**Step 1:** Go to <https://accounts.google.com>.

**Step 2:** Log in and go to Security > Your Devices:

## Method 5: Request Service Provider To Unlock Your Lenovo ThinkPhone  Phone

You can request your service provider to unlock your Lenovo ThinkPhone  phone provided their conditions are met.

## Bonus Tip: If You Want To Disable Screen Lock

This is how to disable screen lock on Android:

**Step 1:** Navigate to Settings > Security > Screen Lock.

**Step 2:** Enter the PIN or pattern.

**Step 3:** Choose None and confirm.

There are a handful of methods you can use to unlock a Lenovo ThinkPhone  phone in case you forget the password or PIN or pattern. Especially for the old pattern-based screen locks, it is easy to unlock the phone if you know the answers to the security questions in your Google account. However, to unlock Lenovo ThinkPhone  phone screen without password on newer Android versions, you need technical knowledge, or you can use third-party software such as Wondershare Dr.Fone. Using Dr.Fone Screen Unlock, you can unlock your phone quickly with no technical mumbo jumbo to confuse you. All you will get is a software that guides you every step of the way so you can unlock Lenovo ThinkPhone  phone easily.
