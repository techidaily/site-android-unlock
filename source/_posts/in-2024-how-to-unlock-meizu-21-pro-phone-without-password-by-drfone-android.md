- You must enter the Gmail account that is associated with the Meizu 21 Pro device here before selecting "Next."

### 2\. Google Find My Device

Using your Google account is a superb method for finding the Meizu 21 Pro device when lost or stolen.

In addition, it may be used to lock or ring your smartphone. You may have noticed that there are three options available when using this feature: "Ring," "Lock," and "Erase."

To bypass the Android lock screen, all you need to do is sign into the Meizu 21 Pro device's associated Google account and then follow these steps:

- On any Android device or a computer, go to <www.google.com/android/find> and sign in using your Google account. Choose the Android smartphone you wish to unlock after that.
- After choosing the Meizu 21 Pro device, select one of the three options, "lock," from the list.
- There will be a new pop-up window that you can use to change the Meizu 21 Pro device password. Additionally, you can choose to add a phone number or recovery email.
