In this part, we will discuss the methods that can be used for removing the previously synced account from your Android phone without a phone reset.

### Method 1: Removing Google Account using the Android Settings Menu

The steps for this method are listed below.

- **Step 1:** On your Android phone go to the Settings option and choose Accounts & Backup.
- **Step 2:** Select the Manage Accounts option now and the list of the associated Google Devices will appear.
- **Step 3:** Choose and click on the Google Account that you want to remove and a pop-up message will appear to inform you that all the account data will be deleted with this action.

To confirm the removal of the account, click on the Remove account button.

## Part 2: How to Disable Factory Reset Protection to Bypass Google Account Verification After Factory Reset

The Factory Reset Protection (FRP) is a security feature for the Android device that allows factory reset only after the associated Google ID and password are entered correctly. With multiple accounts and passwords to remember there is quite a possibility that you may forget your Android phone Google account details and here the need to bypass Google account verification arises.

Though there are multiple tools available we recommend Dr. Fone - Screen Unlock (Android) as the best and the most reliable option. Using this excellent Windows and Mac-based software, FRP lock on all popular Android devices including Samsung, LG, HTC, and others. The tool is simple to use and requires no technology. There is also an option where you can unlock your device if you do not know the OS version.
