### 1\. Privacy Concerns

Some users focus on privacy and feel uncomfortable with Google Smart Lock's access to their passwords. The reason behind this is how easily anyone can access the saved password. All they need to do is access "Manage Passwords" in Google Chrome, and all their passwords will be open. This leads them to opt for more private password management options.

### 2\. Glitches and Technical Issues

Technical glitches in the functioning of Google Smart Lock can be frustrating. This is especially prominent when managing passwords with similar usernames across different websites. The same can happen when using similar passwords for different websites or apps. Users experiencing such issues can seek to remove it to restore regular operations.

### 3\. No Updates

You should be aware that Google Smart Lock for Passwords has been deprecated. This indicates it no longer receives updates or support from Google. Developers are advised to opt for Google's One Tap Sign-in feature as an alternative by Google. It provides a more efficient and secure method for signing in to apps and websites.

### 4\. Preference for Third-Party Tools

Certain users might have a preference for specialized third-party password management tools. They can go for solutions that offer a wider array of features. Many users might want to find options better aligned with their specific needs. This prompts them to disable Google Smart Lock.

## Part 1: How To Track Your Motorola Edge 40 Pro on Google Earth

This **Google Maps IMEI number tracking** issue has caused quite a buzz and controversy on the internet. It has raised many concerns regarding the safety and privacy of every smartphone user. To tell you the truth, Google Earth lacks IMEI location data and does not provide such capabilities. Thus, there is no truth in **tracking IMEI numbers through Google Earth**.

However, if you have access to a cell phone's GPS coordinates or the location of a cell tower to which it is linked, you can use Google Earth to follow its location.

- **Step 1:** This process won't be possible if your location services are not enabled on your phone. To do this, navigate to **Settings,** then **Location** on Android, and **Settings** > **Privacy** > **Location Services** on iOS.
