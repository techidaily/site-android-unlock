## How to Unlock Motorola Moto G 5G (2023) Phone without Google Account?

Uh oh – you’ve forgotten your Android Unlock code, and you can’t get it online to unlock using Google. Nothing could be more frustrating than gazing at your phone, knowing that it is essentially a paperweight at this point. Unless you can get it unlocked, your phone is useless, and all of your important photos, text messages, and content are all locked out of your reach. While right now, nothing can do without a Google account. But you can try to reset your Google account first.

## Part 1: How to Bypass Lock Screen on Android device with Google Account (Android Device Manager)

Even if you have a Google account, if your phone isn’t connected to the internet, you cannot access it to unlock your phone. If this sounds familiar, you can always try this method.

1\. First, navigate to the Android Device Manager page. You will need to sign in with the Google account that you use to set up your phone.

Android Device Manager link: <http://www.google.com/android/devicemanager>

2\. Once you have logged in, you will automatically be redirected to the Android Device Manager page. If this is your first time, click the “Accept” button.

![android Device Manager start](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14637942473262.jpg)

3\. A list of all of the Motorola Moto G 5G (2023) devices registered to this Android account will pop up. Select the Motorola Moto G 5G (2023) device in question from this list.

![android Device Manager list of devices](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14637942503282.jpg)

![android Device Manager locating device](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14637942532352.jpg)

5\. After it has been located, you will have a few options for what to do next. If you do not know your phone's location, you can call it from this screen, but if you know where it is, click the ‘Enable Lock & Erase’ option.

![android Device Manager device located](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14637942568385.jpg)

6\. A notification will pop up on your device; confirm it.

![android Device Manager Erase & Lock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14637942582896.jpg)

7\. At this point, you will be asked to create a new lock screen password. Once you have chosen one, press “Lock.”

![android Device Manager New Lock Screen](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14637943377629.jpg)

8\. Now, simply enter the new passcode on your device, and voila! It will open, and you can get back to your daily routine.

## Part 2: How to Reset Your Google Account on your Android Phone

If you have forgotten your Google Account password, it is still possible to unlock your account and access the information within. Here is how you can unlock your Google account on your Android phone.

1\. On your browser, go to the Google home page and try to sign in. You will fail, but that is good! It will lead you to the next step.

![android Google web page](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14637535742329.jpg)

2\. Since you cannot sign in on the sign-in page, you can now select the ‘Help’ link.

![android Goodle log in](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14637535763672.jpg)

3\. Choose the “forgot password” option. You will be prompted to enter your email address to proceed.

![android Google trouble signing in](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14637535788151.jpg)

4\. Two options will then appear: the first is your phone number, and the other asks you for your backup email.

5\. Enter either one of these options, and you will receive a verification code via email, SMS, or a telephone call from an operator. If you have chosen to enter your backup email, at this point, you will receive detailed instructions on how to access the ‘reset password’ page.

## How to Show Wi-Fi Password on Motorola Moto G 5G (2023)

Since the invention of Android OS in 2008 by Andy Rubin, our world has faced a dramatic change. Android seems to be controlling a considerably high portion of our life. We have bought many gadgets that use this amazing OS and most of which are phones. But how much can you do with your Android phone? Developers are always making it more interesting to use this interface.

Most of the time, we use Android phones, we get faced with the need to access the internet. The Wi-Fi capability of these Android gadgets makes it super easy for us to surf the web. Throughout using Wi-Fi, we connect to a number of them. This could be at school, a sub-way café, the gym, buses, hospitals, hotels, towns, and the list is endless. A password secures most of this. Needless to say, our brain is weak to store all these passwords for future use, especially if you would want to connect with a different gadget you have recently bought or even your laptop. In this article, we will introduce you to how to find wifi password on rooted and also unrooted Android devices.

## Part 1: Show Wifi Password on Rooted Android Device

### What is Rooting?

First of all, what does rooting mean? You have probably used a Windows computer or even Linux. For the case of Windows, when installing a new program or software, it always prompts a dialog box saying, "Administrator permission required to run this program." If you don't have the administrator permission, you won't install the program. In Android, this is called rooting. In simple terms, it means having the root permission to your phone. Some Android apps will require you the root permission, e.g., flashing your ROM. In this part, we will explain how you can show the Wi-Fi password on your Android with root.

To find the Wi-Fi passwords on your Android phone, you need to have an app to explore files which also supports a root user. In this case, ES FileExplorer or Root Explorer will come in handy. However, it turns out that the latter is offered at $3. Let's use the free ES File Explorer.

![android show wifi password](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14556285763404.jpg)

### Steps of getting Wi-Fi password on Android with root

In only four steps, we, at this moment, learn how we can find the password of a Wi-Fi on an Android phone.

Step 1: Install the ES File Explorer

Download the ES File Explorer from your play store, install it, and open it.

![android show wifi password](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14556286507084.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
Step 2: Enable Root Explorer

The root explorer needs to be enabled so that you can reach the root folders of the Wi-Fi passwords you need. By default, the root feature in this ES explorer is not enabled. To enable it, just tap on the list menu on the top left corner.:

![android show wifi password](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14556292611536.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
This will drop down a list of controls. Scroll down and find the **Root Explorer** option and enable it.

![android show wifi password](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14556293052566.jpg)

Step 3: Get the passwords' file.

Go back to ES file explorer, and this time, find the folder named **data**.

![android show wifi password](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14556293412707.jpg)

	<div style="width:720px;text-align:center"><a href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1993650%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);">Click here</a></div>

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
When this folder opens, find another one named **misc**. Open it and find another one named **wifi**. Here, find a file named **wpa\_supplicant.conf**.

![android show wifi password](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14556293762552.jpg)

Step 4: Retrieve the wifi password on Android

Make sure that you don't edit anything in the file. You might mess up with important data and fail to access the Wi-Fi(s) in the future.

![android show wifi password](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14556294042257.jpg)

As you can see above, we have found the Wi-Fi passwords on the android device. On each network profile, we have the name of the network represented by _name (ssid="{the name}")_, the network's password represented by _psk_, the network's access point represented by _key\_mgmt=WPA-PSK_ and its priority represented by _priority_.

## Part 2: Show Wifi Password on Android without Root

What if I don't have root access to my Android, can I still see Android Wi-Fi password? The short answer is yes. However, this is a bit involving but simple. You don't need to be a computer guru to do it, but you need to have a computer and some internet access of course. The key thing is to find a way through which we can fetch the password file from the phone without using a root access protocol in the Android. This is made possible by some little programming insight using the Windows Command prompt.

### Steps to show Wi-Fi password on Android without root

Step 1: Access the Developer authority

To access the files that Android uses to run passwords, you must first become a developer. This is very simple.

Get your Android phone and go to settings. Scroll down and find "About phone." Tap on it and scroll down again to find Build number.

![android show wifi password](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14556302638925.jpg)

Tap on this "build number" 5 to 6 times until a message pops up, saying, "You are now a developer".

![android show wifi password](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14556303263992.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
Step 3: Install ADB drivers.

Now, open your Windows desktop. Download and install ADB drivers. (Use this download link [adbdriver.com](http://adbdriver.com/)). You need to download and install platform tools (minimal ADB and fastboot) from [http://forum.xda-developers.com/...](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2317790) Now open the folder where you've installed the above tools. By default, it is in the Local disc _C\\windows\\system32\\platform\_tools_ location. However, you might want to locate them by searching on the windows search engine. You have to hold the Shift key and right-click inside the folder to click on"Open Command Window Here."

Step 4: Test the ADB

Here, we would like to test whether the ABD is working properly. To do this, connect your phone to the PC using a USB. In the command prompt, type **adb services** and then press enter. If it's working properly, you should see a device on this list.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
Step 5: Find the Android wifi password.

Now, it is time to type the given command in the command prompt and type: _adb pull /data/misc/wifi/wpa\_supplicant.conf c:/wpa\_supplicant.conf_. This will fetch the file from your phone to the local disc C drive of the PC.

Step 6: Get the wifi passwords.

Lastly, open the file with a notepad, and there you go.

## Part 1: How to set up Pattern Lock Screen on Motorola Moto G 5G (2023)?

Out of all the provided options for screen locks, pattern lock is mostly used due to its ease of access and added security. If you haven’t set up a screen lock pattern on your device, then we recommend you to do the same right away. Not only will it keep intruders away, it will also protect your privacy. To learn how to set up a lock screen pattern on an Android device, simply follow these steps:

- 1\. Firstly, unlock your device and go to its Settings. You can access it from the Home Screen or from its Notification Center.
- 2\. Under the personal or privacy section, you can access the “Lock Screen and Security” option.
- 3\. In some versions, the option is also listed right at the top of the settings (in its quick access).

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
- 4\. To set up a pattern lock screen, tap on the “Screen lock type” feature.
- 5\. This will provide a list of all the different kinds of locks that you can apply. Ideally, it would be password, pin, pattern, swipe, or none. In “Swipe”, you can unlock a device just by swiping the screen. Whereas, in pattern, pin, or password, you would be needed to provide the respective pattern/pin/password to unlock the Motorola Moto G 5G (2023) device.
- 6\. We recommend setting up a lock screen pattern instead. To do this, tap on the “Pattern” option.

![setup android pattern lock screen-tap on the “Screen lock type” feature](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/09/15057379466607.jpg) ![setup android pattern lock screen- provide the respective pattern](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/15057379692063.jpg) ![setup android pattern lock screen-tap on the “Pattern” option](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/09/15057379835226.jpg)

- 7\. From the next screen, you can simply draw any kind of pattern of your choice. Ideally, it should join at least 4 dots on the screen. We recommend using a strong screen lock pattern to provide unmatched security to your device.
