## How to Remove Operator Lock on Motorola Moto G84 5G ?

An operator lock, also called a carrier lock, constitutes a limitation imposed on a mobile phone by a network provider. This measure is implemented to guarantee that the Motorola Moto G84 5G device exclusively functions with the services provided by that specific carrier. If you wish to remove the operator lock from your Motorola Moto G84 5G  device, you'll need to follow specific steps and meet certain criteria. Here's how to remove the operator lock on a Motorola Moto G84 5G :

**Step 1:** Begin by checking whether your device can be unlocked or not from its network carrier restrictions. To do that, you need to dial the code “\*#\*#7378423#\*#\*” on your device, tap “Service Info” and select “SIM Lock.”
