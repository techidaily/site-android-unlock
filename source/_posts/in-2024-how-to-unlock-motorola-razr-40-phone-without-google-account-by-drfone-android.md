Almost all Android smartphones, including Motorola Razr 40 , require you to enter your Google account details when setting up your phone for the first time.

## How to Remove Operator Lock on Motorola Razr 40 ?

An operator lock, also called a carrier lock, constitutes a limitation imposed on a mobile phone by a network provider. This measure is implemented to guarantee that the Motorola Razr 40 device exclusively functions with the services provided by that specific carrier. If you wish to remove the operator lock from your Motorola Razr 40  device, you'll need to follow specific steps and meet certain criteria. Here's how to remove the operator lock on a Motorola Razr 40 :

**Step 1:** Begin by checking whether your device can be unlocked or not from its network carrier restrictions. To do that, you need to dial the code “\*#\*#7378423#\*#\*” on your device, tap “Service Info” and select “SIM Lock.”

![dial the provided number](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/10/unlock-sony-xperia-pin-code-5.jpg)

**Step 2:** Carefully check the information provided on the screen. If there is "X" before the "Network" option and the number in front of it is larger than 0, it means your device can be unlocked. If the number in front of "Network" is 0, your device can't be unlocked as it is hard-locked.
