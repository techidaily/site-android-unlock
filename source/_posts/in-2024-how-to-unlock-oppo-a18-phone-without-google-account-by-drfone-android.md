Unless you can get it unlocked, your phone is useless, and all of your important photos, text messages, and content are all locked out of your reach.

## Part 5: Unlock locked Oppo A18  phone with Gmail ID and password

It is imperative to understand that unlocking your Oppo A18  Phone using a Gmail ID and password should be your last resort and especially if you are using an older version of Android. Among all the tricks of how to reset a Oppo A18  phone that is locked, it only works if you are running around version 4.4 KitKat or older than that. Neither less to say, in order for the step to work properly, you need your Gmail account to be properly configured with the Oppo A18 device.

**Step 1: Attempt Passwords**

At first, you need to make five attempts to unlock your device. Whether you have used a PIN or Pattern lock, Android will always give you five attempts to get the password right. Once you get that, it will trigger the “Forget Password/Pattern” option on Your Oppo A18. This way, you can sneak back into the system once again.
