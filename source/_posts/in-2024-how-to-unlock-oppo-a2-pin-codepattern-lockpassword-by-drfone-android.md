## How to Remove Operator Lock on Oppo A2 ?

An operator lock, also called a carrier lock, constitutes a limitation imposed on a mobile phone by a network provider. This measure is implemented to guarantee that the Oppo A2 device exclusively functions with the services provided by that specific carrier. If you wish to remove the operator lock from your Oppo A2  device, you'll need to follow specific steps and meet certain criteria. Here's how to remove the operator lock on a Oppo A2 :

**Step 1:** Begin by checking whether your device can be unlocked or not from its network carrier restrictions. To do that, you need to dial the code “\*#\*#7378423#\*#\*” on your device, tap “Service Info” and select “SIM Lock.”

![dial the provided number](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/10/unlock-sony-xperia-pin-code-5.jpg)

**Step 2:** Carefully check the information provided on the screen. If there is "X" before the "Network" option and the number in front of it is larger than 0, it means your device can be unlocked. If the number in front of "Network" is 0, your device can't be unlocked as it is hard-locked.

![check the network status](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/10/unlock-sony-xperia-pin-code-6.jpg)

### Method 5: Keep Unread Notifications

To avoid adjusting your Android device settings, you can make the lock screen clock smaller by maintaining unread notifications. The clock occupies less space when there are unread notifications. It shifts back to the top-left corner when you receive a new notification. Simply leave notifications unread to keep the clock smaller.

For users who prefer not to have a lock screen clock, follow these steps:

- **Step 1**: Open **Settings** > **Lock screen** or **Security & lock screen**.
- **Step 2**: Look for **Clock and FaceWidgets** or a similar option. Disable or toggle off the **Clock** or **Show clock** setting. Save changes, and your lock screen should no longer display the clock.
