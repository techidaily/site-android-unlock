## Method 3: Factory Reset Samsung Galaxy A34 5G  Phones (Wipes User Data)

There is a standard factory reset built into every Samsung Galaxy A34 5G  phone to allow users to erase the Samsung Galaxy A34 5G device and start over fully. This option wipes all user data and resets the phone to how you received it in the box. Naturally, this is not a preferred way, as it requires the phone to be set up all over again and that takes time. Also, all data will need to be backed up beforehand in order to restore it again. Overall, this method consumes a lot of time.

**Step 1:** Go to Settings > Backup & Reset.

**Step 2:** Tap Factory Reset > Reset Phone.

**Step 3:** Tap Erase Everything.

Using Find My Device, you can play a sound on the Samsung Galaxy A34 5G device to locate it in the house if you have misplaced it, lock the phone in case it is lost, and wipe the Samsung Galaxy A34 5G device remotely.

**Step 1:** Go to <https://accounts.google.com>.

This is how to disable screen lock on Android:

**Step 1:** Navigate to Settings > Security > Screen Lock.

**Step 2:** Enter the PIN or pattern.

**Step 3:** Choose None and confirm.
