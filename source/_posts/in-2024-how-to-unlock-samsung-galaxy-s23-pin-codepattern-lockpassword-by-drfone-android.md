## How to Remove Operator Lock on Samsung Galaxy S23 ?

An operator lock, also called a carrier lock, constitutes a limitation imposed on a mobile phone by a network provider. This measure is implemented to guarantee that the Samsung Galaxy S23 device exclusively functions with the services provided by that specific carrier. If you wish to remove the operator lock from your Samsung Galaxy S23  device, you'll need to follow specific steps and meet certain criteria. Here's how to remove the operator lock on a Samsung Galaxy S23 :

**Step 1:** Begin by checking whether your device can be unlocked or not from its network carrier restrictions. To do that, you need to dial the code “\*#\*#7378423#\*#\*” on your device, tap “Service Info” and select “SIM Lock.”

![dial the provided number](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/10/unlock-sony-xperia-pin-code-5.jpg)

**Step 2:** Carefully check the information provided on the screen. If there is "X" before the "Network" option and the number in front of it is larger than 0, it means your device can be unlocked. If the number in front of "Network" is 0, your device can't be unlocked as it is hard-locked.

![check the network status](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/10/unlock-sony-xperia-pin-code-6.jpg)

**Step 3:** The next step involves getting your device’s IMEI number. To accomplish this task, simply input "\*#06#" on your device. Once you have the IMEI number, use a reliable service from the internet to the unlocking code. Insert the SIM card of another network and provide the code you gained to unlock your Samsung Galaxy S23  device.

## Rootjunky APK To Bypass Google FRP Lock For Samsung Galaxy S23 

Factory Reset Protection (FRP) is a security feature built into Android devices running Android 5.1 Lollipop and later versions. It prevents someone from using your phone after a factory data reset without Google account login credentials. The FRP makes it much less attractive for thieves to steal Android phones, knowing they will need help to access them.

FRP automatically activates when you add a Google account to your Android phone. It links the Samsung Galaxy S23 device to your account, making it the “trusted owner.” Once activated, FRP becomes embedded in the phone’s system.

While Google FRP is a valuable security feature, it’s vital to acknowledge that there are legitimate situations where bypassing it might be necessary. These instances include forgotten Google account credentials, buying a second-hand device, and device issues. In these cases, tools like **RootJunky** can help you [<u>bypass FRP Lock</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/google-frp-unlock/bypass-frp-with-computer.html). We’ll explore how to use **RootJunky APK** later, but first, let’s define what it is and its role in FRP bypass.

![holding an android smartphone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/rootjunky-01.jpg)


The **RootJunky APK** is a free Android application also called RootJunky SDL or **RootJunky FRP** Bypass tool. This app’s primary function is to bypass the Google Account FRP lock on Samsung devices. Rootjunky uses the weaknesses in Android’s setup process to create a new user account or switch existing ones, letting you bypass the FRP and regain control of your phone.

You can complete this process using the app by connecting your phone to a computer through an OTG cable. **RootJunky** can be helpfu l if you’ve forgotten your Google account password or bought a second-hand phone locked to someone else’s account. However, only use it if you have legitimate reasons to bypass FRP lock, like accessing your device after forgetting your Google account details.

![rootjunky logo](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/rootjunky-02.jpg)

Downloading the **RootJunky FRP** bypass tool from unofficial sources can introduce malware risks, so stick to trusted sources like the official website. Additionally, when exploring RootJunky, it is vital to keep the following in mind:

- Not all Android devices are susceptible to the methods used by RootJunky. It is necessary to check compatibility with your specific device model and Android version.
- Using FRP bypass tools like RootJunkycan potentially compromise the security of your device. Be cautious and proceed if you fully understand the risks involved.
- Bypassing FRP may involve data loss.
- Download **RootJunky FRP** bypass APK from a reliable source to minimize the risk of malware or viruses. You can check the APK file from official websites or trusted forums.
- Google constantly updates its security measures, so these tools may not always work effectively.
