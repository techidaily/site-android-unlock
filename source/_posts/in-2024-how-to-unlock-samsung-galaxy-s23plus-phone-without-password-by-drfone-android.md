### 2\. Google Find My Device

Using your Google account is a superb method for finding the Samsung Galaxy S23+ device when lost or stolen.

In addition, it may be used to lock or ring your smartphone. You may have noticed that there are three options available when using this feature: "Ring," "Lock," and "Erase."

To bypass the Android lock screen, all you need to do is sign into the Samsung Galaxy S23+ device's associated Google account and then follow these steps:

- On any Android device or a computer, go to <www.google.com/android/find> and sign in using your Google account. Choose the Android smartphone you wish to unlock after that.
- After choosing the Samsung Galaxy S23+ device, select one of the three options, "lock," from the list.

After that, use Find My Device to unlock your Android phone without losing any data by following the instructions below:
