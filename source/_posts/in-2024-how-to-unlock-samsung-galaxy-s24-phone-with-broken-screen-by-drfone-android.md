## Part 1: How To Track Your Samsung Galaxy S24 on Google Earth

This **Google Maps IMEI number tracking** issue has caused quite a buzz and controversy on the internet. It has raised many concerns regarding the safety and privacy of every smartphone user. To tell you the truth, Google Earth lacks IMEI location data and does not provide such capabilities. Thus, there is no truth in **tracking IMEI numbers through Google Earth**.

Well, you have come to know great things about the two pattern lock remover tools: Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock and Android Multi Tool.

Now, take a look at these tools' comparison.

| **Features** | **Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (Android) ![hot icon](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/05/hot-tip.png)**  | **Android Multi Tool** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Unlock pattern locks without deleting data | Yes | Yes |
| Easy to use | Yes | Technical skills required. |
| High-success Rate | Yes | This tool may sometimes not work.  |

One of the standout features of [Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (Android)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare-dr-fone-unlock-android-screen/) is its simplicity. The software is designed to be easy to use, even for those with little technical knowledge.
