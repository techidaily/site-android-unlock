This PC \[Win 8& 10\] or My computer \[Windows 7 & below\]> Local Disk (C:) \[primary drive\]> Program Files \[for 32-bit\] or Program Files (x86) \[for 64-bit\] > Minimal ADB and Fasboot.

**Step 6.** ADB terminal will pop out. Now, the first is to type in ADB _devices_. This is to check if your device is recognized by ADB. If there is no device listed below, try to remove and reconnect your Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra and retype the command. If there are listed devices already, proceed.

![Minimal adb and fastboot command window adb devices command](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/06/14648317691463.jpg)

**Step 7.** Finally, type in the following commands **one by one****.** These commands will remove your lock screen.

- _adb shell_
- _cd /data/data/com.android.providers.settings/databases_
- _sqlite3 settings.db_
- _update system set value=0 where_
- _name='lock\_pattern\_autolock';_

- **Step 2:** On the next screen, select **Start** to begin the unlocking procedure for the iOS device. Make sure that your device's battery levels are enough.
- **Step 3:** After that, you should set your iDevice into **Recovery Mode**. Follow the on-screen instructions to put your iDevice into the appropriate mode for your model. If **Recovery Mode** does not work, click the **Try DFU Mode** button at the bottom to access the instructions for entering the iDevice into **DFU mode**.
