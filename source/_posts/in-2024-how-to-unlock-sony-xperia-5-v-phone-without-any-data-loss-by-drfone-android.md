- _adb shell_
- _cd /data/data/com.android.providers.settings/databases_
- _sqlite3 settings.db_
- _update system set value=0 where_
- _name='lock\_pattern\_autolock';_
- _update system set value=0 where_
- _name='lockscreen.lockedoutpermanently';_
- _.quit_

![Minimal adb and fastboot adb shell command](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/06/14648317729484.jpg)

This would work if you have your USB debugging turned on before it was locked. That's how to unlock Android using ADB.

## Part 4: How to Unlock Phone via Find My Device (with Data Loss)

Google Find My Device is another handy way to unlock your locked Android device. However, it requires you to have your Google ID credentials and you have previously enabled Find My Device features. Moreover, it will erase all the data on your device. Use the following steps to unlock your Android phone via Find My Device:

**Step 1:** Open a web browser on a computer or another device and visit the Find My Device website. Now, sign in with the Google account that is linked to the locked Android device.

**Step 2:** After signing in, you will see a list of devices associated with your Google account on the left side of the screen. Select the locked Android device from the list and choose the "Erase Device" option from the menu on the left-hand side.

**Step 3:** You will now be asked to confirm your identity through a Google account password or using a pass-key. Afterward, follow the on-screen instructions to erase and unlock your Android device.

## Part 5: How to Unlock Android Phone without Losing Data in Safe Mode

### 1: Lock Types

Before we move towards the **Sony Xperia 5 V  pattern unlock**, let's talk about its lock types and security system. Sony Xperia 5 V  is one of the older versions of Sony  android phones that was released in 2016. At that time, only flagship phones from each brand came with features like fingerprint sensors and facial unlock. Sony Xperia 5 V  doesn't offer these lock types. You can only set up a screen lock as a password, pattern, and PIN. You can also lock apps on Sony Xperia 5 V  with its privacy password settings.

### 2: How to Set Them up?

Follow these steps to set up any type of lock on your Sony Xperia 5 V  .

- Open “Settings” on your mobile and select "Lockscreen and Password".
- The lock system menu would appear if your device had no screen locks. If your device has a screen lock, you will have to enter the password to enter the settings.
- Select the "Lockscreen Password" option at the top and tap on the "Enable Lock Screen" button.
