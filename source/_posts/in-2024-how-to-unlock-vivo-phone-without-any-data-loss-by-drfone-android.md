## Bonus Tip: Are There Preventive Measures To Avoid Future Lockouts?

Want to prevent future lockouts and ensure a smoother smartphone experience? Consider implementing the following preventive measures:

### 1\. Setting Up Alternative Lock Methods

One way to avoid getting locked out of your Vivo S18e  phone is to set up alternative lock methods. In addition to PINs, passwords, and patterns, you can use biometric methods. These include fingerprint recognition or facial recognition if your device supports them. Such options provide convenient and secure ways to unlock your phone.

### 2\. Regularly Backing Up Your Data

Regular data backups are crucial to safeguarding your essential files and information. Utilize cloud backup services or local backup solutions to routinely save your data. In case of a lockout or a factory reset, you can quickly restore your data without loss.

### 3\. Using Secure and Memorable Passwords

When setting up lock methods, opt for strong, unique, and memorable passwords. Avoid using easily guessable information like birthdays or simple patterns. Strong passwords can enhance security while minimizing the chances of forgetting your credentials.

## Conclusion

There is no point in arguing that looking through how to reset a Vivo S18e  phone that is locked after you have forgotten the password is indeed a hectic process. But, there is a way around it too. By going through all the steps mentioned above, you can always get an unlocked phone with ease.
