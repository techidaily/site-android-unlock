## Method 1: Unlock Vivo T2 Pro 5G  Phones Running Older Android OS (4.4 Or Below) With Google Security Questions

Up until Android version 4.4, you could lock your phone screen with a pattern. Google allowed you to unlock the phone by answering security questions in case you forgot the pattern. Since these may also be easily guessed by people who are in possession of your device illegally, Google deprecated this method after Android 4.4. However, the phones running Android 4.4 or lower are still allowed to be unlocked using this method. So, if you have an old Vivo T2 Pro 5G  with Android 4.4 or earlier, here is **how to unlock Vivo T2 Pro 5G  phone password without factory reset**:

**Step 1:** You may already have entered the incorrect pattern a few times. If so, simply tap the Forgot Pattern to start the process of unlocking your Vivo T2 Pro 5G  phone screen. Else, deliberately enter incorrect pattern a few times till you see the Forgot Pattern option:

![unlock motorola phone with security questions](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/09/full-guide-to-unlock-motorola-phones-2.jpg)

**Step 2:** Next, choose the option to reset the pattern by answering your Google credentials.

**Step 3:** Sign into the Google account that matches with the Google account on the phone.

**Step 4:** Lastly, create a new pattern to unlock your Vivo T2 Pro 5G  phone.

### Side Tip

Now that you have unlocked your Vivo T2 Pro 5G  phone with Google security questions, we have a tip for you. For the safety and security of your data on your phone, it might be time to trade in the Vivo T2 Pro 5G device for a newer phone with the latest Android OS. Between Android 4.4 and the Android 12 prevalent today, there have been massive security updates and code improvements that you can benefit from. It makes sense given that our phones hold a substantially large part of our personal and professional lives these days. And we are not even talking about features that you may or may not need - we are talking only from a data security point of view. Of course, you will also benefit from the massive performance improvements that have taken place thanks to hardware and software improvements over the years.

## Method 3: Factory Reset Vivo T2 Pro 5G  Phones (Wipes User Data)

There is a standard factory reset built into every Vivo T2 Pro 5G  phone to allow users to erase the Vivo T2 Pro 5G device and start over fully.

Overall, this method consumes a lot of time.

**Step 1:** Go to Settings > Backup & Reset.

**Step 2:** Tap Factory Reset > Reset Phone.

**Step 3:** Tap Erase Everything.
