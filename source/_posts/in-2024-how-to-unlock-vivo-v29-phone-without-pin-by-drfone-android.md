Step 1: Open the Settings menu from the main screen. Then tap on the Credential Storage. You will see a drop-down menu like the screenshot below.

## Part 2. How To Change Lock Screen Clock on Android \[5 Methods\]

Currently, there isn’t an official method to **change the lock screen clock on Android** 12. However, there are several workarounds you can do. Let’s explore these techniques and see which works best for you.

### Method 1: Change Your Wallpaper

In Android 11, adjusting your wallpaper is accessible through the Android Settings menu.

- **Step 1A:** Navigate to the “All Apps” screen and select **Settings**. For Samsung Galaxy devices on Android 11, access the **Wallpaper** option within the settings menu.

In Android 12, the process remains consistent.
