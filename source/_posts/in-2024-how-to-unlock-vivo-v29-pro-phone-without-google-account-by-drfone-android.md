Uh oh – you’ve forgotten your Android Unlock code, and you can’t get it online to unlock using Google.

Unless you can get it unlocked, your phone is useless, and all of your important photos, text messages, and content are all locked out of your reach. While right now, nothing can do without a Google account. But you can try to reset your Google account first.
