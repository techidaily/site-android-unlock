### 3\. Use ADB

This fix isn't guaranteed to work; if you don't watch out, it could damage your phone. Therefore, we suggest you back up everything on your Android before proceeding.

If your phone has USB debugging enabled, is connected to a PC, and is not encrypted, follow these steps:

- Connect your device to your PC through a USB connector.
- Open Command Prompt or Terminal window to your ADB installation registry.
- Type in adb shell rm/data/system/gesture.key and click the Enter key.
- Reboot your phone. When you do, the solid lock screen ought to be gone.
- That is not a permanent condition, so reset your PIN or password lock before you reboot your device once more. That's how you reset **password for phone.**

### 4.Dr.Fone-Screen Unlock

## Part 3: How to Back up My Vivo V29e Easily?

### Dr.Fone-Phone Backup

As we all know, unlocking a **lock screen password** involves a hard reset, which can delete your user data. Therefore, you must back up your files before hard resetting.

There are several tools available to back up your files. You can use Google or your phone manufacturer's cloud services to back up your file. However, none of them are secure enough. So, we suggest Dr.Fone-Phone Backup have a secure and reliable backup experience. Dr.Fone lets you choose the files you need and back them up. Moreover, you can restore those files to your phone once it gets unlocked.
