It is imperative to understand that unlocking your Vivo X90S  Phone using a Gmail ID and password should be your last resort and especially if you are using an older version of Android.

Neither less to say, in order for the step to work properly, you need your Gmail account to be properly configured with the Vivo X90S device.

**Step 1: Attempt Passwords**
