However, they can also help with basic issues like unlocking your phone in case you forget your Vivo Y100  screen unlock PIN, pattern, or password.

You can unlock your Vivo Y100  phone with Google Account in the following two ways:

- Using Google account details
- Using Google security question

### Using Google Account Details

Almost all Android smartphones, including Vivo Y100 , require you to enter your Google account details when setting up your phone for the first time.

If you don't remember your Google account details, you can still unlock your Vivo Y100  phone using a third-party tool.

Hard resetting your smartphone usually solves everything! Hence, it can also help you unlock your Vivo Y100  phone; however, using this method will erase all the data on your phone. So, if you still want to unlock Vivo Y100  phone using this method, only do so if you have backed up your device and have no other way to unlock your phone. This includes forgetting your Google account details or not having access to a PC to download and use Dr Fone - Screen Unlock (Android).

Here are the steps for it:

- **Step 1:** Power off your Vivo Y100  phone.

## How to Remove Operator Lock on Vivo Y100 ?

An operator lock, also called a carrier lock, constitutes a limitation imposed on a mobile phone by a network provider. This measure is implemented to guarantee that the Vivo Y100 device exclusively functions with the services provided by that specific carrier. If you wish to remove the operator lock from your Vivo Y100  device, you'll need to follow specific steps and meet certain criteria. Here's how to remove the operator lock on a Vivo Y100 :

**Step 1:** Begin by checking whether your device can be unlocked or not from its network carrier restrictions. To do that, you need to dial the code “\*#\*#7378423#\*#\*” on your device, tap “Service Info” and select “SIM Lock.”

![dial the provided number](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/10/unlock-sony-xperia-pin-code-5.jpg)

**Step 2:** Carefully check the information provided on the screen. If there is "X" before the "Network" option and the number in front of it is larger than 0, it means your device can be unlocked. If the number in front of "Network" is 0, your device can't be unlocked as it is hard-locked.

![check the network status](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/10/unlock-sony-xperia-pin-code-6.jpg)

**Step 3:** The next step involves getting your device’s IMEI number. To accomplish this task, simply input "\*#06#" on your device. Once you have the IMEI number, use a reliable service from the internet to the unlocking code. Insert the SIM card of another network and provide the code you gained to unlock your Vivo Y100  device.

## Bonus Tip: How to Unlock Bootloader?

Unlocking the bootloader on your Android device provides significant advantages. These actions encompass obtaining root access, installing custom ROMs, configuring custom recoveries, and carrying out advanced procedures. Here's an essential guide on unlocking the bootloader of your Sony device while keeping all precautions in mind:

**Step 1:** To start with the process, verify the bootloader status for your Sony smartphone. On opening the "Dialer" app, dial the number "\*#\*#7378423#\*#\*" and access the "Rooting Status" option within the "Service Provider" settings.

**Step 2:** If the bootloader status displays "Yes," ensure that the Sony USB drivers and ADB tools are installed on your computer. Enable "USB Debugging" and "OEM Unlocking" on your smartphone and switch it off.

**Step 3:** Connect the Vivo Y100  smartphone with a USB cable and press the "Power + Volume Up" keys for a few seconds. Open the Windows computer and access the "Devices and Printers" directory.

**Step 4:** Open the official “Sony Unlocking Site” and add in the IMEI number. On acknowledging, use the commands as follows: `adb reboot bootloader`

Unlock the bootloader with the following command: `fastboot oem unlock 0x<insert your unlock code`

Verify the bootloader is unlocked and use the command to reboot the system; if not done automatically: `fastboot reboot`
