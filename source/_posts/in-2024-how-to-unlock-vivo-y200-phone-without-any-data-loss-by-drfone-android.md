![Minimal adb and fastboot installation complete](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/06/14648313566582.jpg)

**Step 4.** Make sure your device is connected, then go to the Minimal ADB and Fastboot installation directory.

This PC \[Win 8& 10\] or My computer \[Windows 7 & below\]> Local Disk (C:) \[primary drive\]> Program Files \[for 32-bit\] or Program Files (x86) \[for 64-bit\] > Minimal ADB and Fasboot.

![Program Files (x86) folder](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/06/14648313591963.jpg)

![Minimal adb and fastboot folder](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/06/14648313625020.jpg)
