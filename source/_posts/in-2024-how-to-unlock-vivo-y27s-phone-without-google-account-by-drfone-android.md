## How to Unlock Vivo Y27s Phone without Google Account?

Uh oh – you’ve forgotten your Android Unlock code, and you can’t get it online to unlock using Google. Nothing could be more frustrating than gazing at your phone, knowing that it is essentially a paperweight at this point. Unless you can get it unlocked, your phone is useless, and all of your important photos, text messages, and content are all locked out of your reach. While right now, nothing can do without a Google account. But you can try to reset your Google account first.

## Part 1: How to Bypass Lock Screen on Android device with Google Account (Android Device Manager)
