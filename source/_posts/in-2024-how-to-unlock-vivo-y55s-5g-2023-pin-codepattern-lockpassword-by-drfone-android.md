If you wish to remove the operator lock from your Vivo Y55s 5G (2023)  device, you'll need to follow specific steps and meet certain criteria. Here's how to remove the operator lock on a Vivo Y55s 5G (2023) :

**Step 1:** Begin by checking whether your device can be unlocked or not from its network carrier restrictions. To do that, you need to dial the code “\*#\*#7378423#\*#\*” on your device, tap “Service Info” and select “SIM Lock.”
