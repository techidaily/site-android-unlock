### 1\. A Picture Possibly Bypasses Face Lock

You can use your photo to manipulate the face lock app. Simply use your photo to unlock the phone, which should work fine. If your phone doesn't recognize your face from a photo, try again.

If it still doesn't recognize your face, try a different photo or even change the camera's lighting settings or the angles to see if that helps.

Anyway, this method is still unstable because of many uncontrollable factors. If everything fails, consider the following methods to bypass the face lock.

### 2\. Hard Reset your phone

To get around the Android lock screen, perform a factory reset. While resetting your phone allows you to set a new password, it also erases all data from your device. This method works like a charm, but it also requires more technical knowledge. To bypass screen lock via factory reset, follow these steps.

![android hard reset](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/face-unlock-android-2.jpg)

**Step 1**: Turn off your phone and hold the Power and Volume-down buttons simultaneously until the recovery mode screen appears. There are minor variations depending on the brand and model.

**Step 2**: Select the Wipe data/Factory Reset option using the volume buttons. To confirm the option, press the Power button.

**Step 3**: Choose Yes > Delete All User Data, then press the power button to continue. When the process is complete, turn on your phone.

So, before facing such awkward cases, like data loss, we suggest you have a backup habit of keeping your data safe.

## Pro Tips: Unlock Your Android Phones When You Forgot the Fingerprint

Setting a fingerprint lock or PIN, password, pattern, or even FRP lock on an Android phone is a common way to prevent our important data or private info from being prying eyes. However, if you forgot the fingerprint, or get your Android phone broken with a screen cracked, and enter the wrong password several times, you will be stuck on the problem and won’t be able to access your phone and all the apps on the Vivo Y78 5G device. Don't be too worried. Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (Android) provides you with an Android phone unlocking feature to unlock any phone fingerprint and any screen locks, including numeric password, pattern, 4-digit/6-digit/custom PIN, fingerprint ID, face recognition, etc.
