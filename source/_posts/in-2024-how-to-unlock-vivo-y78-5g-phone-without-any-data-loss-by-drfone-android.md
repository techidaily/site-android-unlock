## Part 2. Some Prominent Limitations of vnROM Bypass

**vnROM Bypass** offers a solution for bypassing FRP lock on certain Android devices. Yet, it comes with several notable limitations that necessitate exploring alternative options. The following are some of the limitations of vnROM Bypass:

### 1\. Limited Compatibility
