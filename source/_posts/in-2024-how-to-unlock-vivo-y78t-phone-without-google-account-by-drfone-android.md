## How to Unlock Vivo Y78t Phone without Google Account?

Uh oh – you’ve forgotten your Android Unlock code, and you can’t get it online to unlock using Google. Nothing could be more frustrating than gazing at your phone, knowing that it is essentially a paperweight at this point. Unless you can get it unlocked, your phone is useless, and all of your important photos, text messages, and content are all locked out of your reach. While right now, nothing can do without a Google account. But you can try to reset your Google account first.

## Part 1: How to Bypass Lock Screen on Android device with Google Account (Android Device Manager)

Even if you have a Google account, if your phone isn’t connected to the internet, you cannot access it to unlock your phone. If this sounds familiar, you can always try this method.

1\. First, navigate to the Android Device Manager page. You will need to sign in with the Google account that you use to set up your phone.

Android Device Manager link: <http://www.google.com/android/devicemanager>

2\. Once you have logged in, you will automatically be redirected to the Android Device Manager page. If this is your first time, click the “Accept” button.

3\. A list of all of the Vivo Y78t devices registered to this Android account will pop up. Select the Vivo Y78t device in question from this list.

![android Device Manager list of devices](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14637942503282.jpg)

4\. The Android Device Manager will then locate your device. Make sure it is turned on!

![android Device Manager locating device](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14637942532352.jpg)

5\. After it has been located, you will have a few options for what to do next. If you do not know your phone's location, you can call it from this screen, but if you know where it is, click the ‘Enable Lock & Erase’ option.

![android Device Manager device located](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14637942568385.jpg)

6\. A notification will pop up on your device; confirm it.

![android Device Manager Erase & Lock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14637942582896.jpg)

![android Device Manager New Lock Screen](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14637943377629.jpg)

## Part 2: How to Reset Your Google Account on your Android Phone

If you have forgotten your Google Account password, it is still possible to unlock your account and access the information within. Here is how you can unlock your Google account on your Android phone.

1\. On your browser, go to the Google home page and try to sign in. You will fail, but that is good! It will lead you to the next step.

![android Google web page](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14637535742329.jpg)

2\. Since you cannot sign in on the sign-in page, you can now select the ‘Help’ link.

![android Goodle log in](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14637535763672.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

5\. Enter either one of these options, and you will receive a verification code via email, SMS, or a telephone call from an operator. If you have chosen to enter your backup email, at this point, you will receive detailed instructions on how to access the ‘reset password’ page.

![android Google reset link](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14637552475841.jpg)

## How to look up saved passwords on my device?

The way that Google Chrome manages your usernames and passwords is excellent. But what if you want to log in to a particular website from another device but can't recall your password, and the website won't load the data for you? You may quickly obtain a list of all saved passwords by browsing through Chrome's settings, then manually keying it in.

You may access the passwords saved in the Google Chrome app on a Mac or PC because the app is connected to your Google account. Any passwords saved on your Android phone can easily be removed via the Chrome app.

## Part 2. Recognizing Some Top Features of Google Smart Lock

Google Smart Lock’s password management has revolutionized how users handle and secure their login credentials. It remains a cornerstone when handling Android devices and computer systems. The following are several notable features that significantly enhance user convenience and security:

### 1\. Password Autofill

Google Smart Lock simplifies the login process across apps and websites. It does that by automatically filling in saved credentials. This eliminates the need for users to remember and manually input passwords.

### 2\. Cross-Platform Synchronization

It synchronizes saved passwords across multiple devices using the same Google account. This ensures smooth access to credentials on Android devices and computers.

### 3\. Secure Storage

Passwords stored within Google Smart Lock are encrypted and securely stored in the user's Google account. This maintains confidentiality and safeguards sensitive login information.

### 4\. Effortless Password Generation

It allows the creation of strong and unique passwords when signing up for new accounts. That enhances overall account security and allows users to have strong passwords.

These features significantly ease the burden of password management and enhance user security. Yet, **Google Smart Lock** does have limitations that prompt some users to consider removing it.

Some users focus on privacy and feel uncomfortable with Google Smart Lock's access to their passwords. The reason behind this is how easily anyone can access the saved password.
