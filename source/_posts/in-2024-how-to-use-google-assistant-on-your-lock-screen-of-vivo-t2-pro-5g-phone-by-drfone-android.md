Once Google Assistant is active, issue a voice command related to the task you want to perform. For example:

"Hey Google, what's the weather today?"

Unable to use **Google Assistant to unlock phone** is not the only drawback that users may have encountered in recent changes.

1. **Misunderstandings and misinterpretations**

One prevalent issue users encounter is Google Assistant misunderstanding or misinterpreting voice commands. This can be influenced by factors such as background noise, accent variations, or pronunciation differences.

2. **Limited context understanding**

### Tips to Make Voice Google Assistant Recognize Your Commands

One of the most infuriating problems with voice Google Assistant is that users often encounter difficulties in having their commands accurately recognized. To enhance the accuracy of voice recognition with Google Assistant, you can consider implementing the following tips:

1. **Speak Clearly and Naturally**

Make sure that you speak in a clear and natural manner. Avoid mumbling or speaking too quickly. Enunciate your words, giving Google Assistant a better chance to interpret your commands accurately.

2. **Use Simple and Direct Phrases**

Keep your commands simple and direct. Avoid unnecessary elaboration or complex sentence structures. Google Assistant is more likely to understand straightforward commands.

3. **Check Your Microphone**

Ensure that your device's microphone is in good working condition. Dirt or debris on your phone's microphone can affect its performance. Clean the microphone area and try again.

4. **Quiet Environment**

Background noise can interfere with voice recognition. Try to issue commands in a quiet environment to minimize any potential confusion caused by external sounds.
