## Part 1: Lock System About Motorola Moto G84 5G  

### 1: Lock Types

Before we move towards the **Motorola Moto G84 5G  pattern unlock**, let's talk about its lock types and security system.

### 4: Hard Reset (data loss)

A hard reset would be the best solution if you forgot your phone's lock screen password or pattern. However, you can unlock your phone with your Google account as well. Do a hard reset if you can't remember your Google account password and don't want to use third-party tools. The only problem with hard resetting is that you lose all your data, images, files, settings, and personalization. That is why you can't recover any of your data after the hard reset if you don't have a data backup. The process of hard reset is different for every device. Here are the steps for **Motorola Moto G84 5G  pattern unlock without a PC** through a hard reset.

- Switch off your Motorola Moto G84 5G  with the power button.
