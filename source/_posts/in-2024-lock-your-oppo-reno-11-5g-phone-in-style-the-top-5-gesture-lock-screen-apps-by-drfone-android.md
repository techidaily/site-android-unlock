## Method 3: Factory Reset Oppo Reno 11 5G  Phones (Wipes User Data)

There is a standard factory reset built into every Oppo Reno 11 5G  phone to allow users to erase the Oppo Reno 11 5G device and start over fully. This option wipes all user data and resets the phone to how you received it in the box. Naturally, this is not a preferred way, as it requires the phone to be set up all over again and that takes time. Also, all data will need to be backed up beforehand in order to restore it again. Overall, this method consumes a lot of time.

**Step 1:** Go to Settings > Backup & Reset.

**Step 2:** Tap Factory Reset > Reset Phone.

**Step 3:** Tap Erase Everything.

## Method 4: Use Google Find My Device To Unlock Oppo Reno 11 5G  Phones (Wipes User Data)

Using Find My Device, you can play a sound on the Oppo Reno 11 5G device to locate it in the house if you have misplaced it, lock the phone in case it is lost, and wipe the Oppo Reno 11 5G device remotely.

**Step 1:** Go to <https://accounts.google.com>.

![unlock motorola phone with google](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/09/full-guide-to-unlock-motorola-phones-10.jpg)
