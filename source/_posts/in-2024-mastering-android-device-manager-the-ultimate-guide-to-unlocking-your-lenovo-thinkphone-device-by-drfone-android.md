### 3: Answer Security Questions

If you want to unlock your Lenovo  phone, you can also answer some security questions and reset the password. This method does not work on all Lenovo  devices, but you can use it for **Lenovo ThinkPhone  screen unlock without PC**. You will see various questions if your Google account is linked with the Lenovo ThinkPhone device. All questions are based on your profile and credentials. You have to answer precisely with proper spaces. Here are the steps to unlock Lenovo ThinkPhone  with security questions.

![Lenovo ThinkPhone  forgot pattern interface](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/oppo-a37-password-unlock-03.jpg)

- Use a random password or PIN five times and wait for the 30 seconds alert message.
- Tap on the “Forgot Pattern” option and move to the next screen.

- Tap on the “Next” button and answer every question that comes up.
- If you give correct answers, the system will open the screen lock.

### 4: Hard Reset (data loss)

A hard reset would be the best solution if you forgot your phone's lock screen password or pattern. However, you can unlock your phone with your Google account as well. Do a hard reset if you can't remember your Google account password and don't want to use third-party tools. The only problem with hard resetting is that you lose all your data, images, files, settings, and personalization. That is why you can't recover any of your data after the hard reset if you don't have a data backup. The process of hard reset is different for every device. Here are the steps for **Lenovo ThinkPhone  pattern unlock without a PC** through a hard reset.

- Switch off your Lenovo ThinkPhone  with the power button.

![power key](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/oppo-a37-password-unlock-04.jpg)

- Press and hold the Volume down + Power buttons together for a few seconds. Hold the keys until you see the Lenovo  logo on the screen.
