_Using the Android Device Manager to track a lost phone_


## Part 1: What is Android Device Manager lock?

Android Device Manager is Google’s take on Apple’s Find My iPhone. Enabling the ADM is quite easy; just go to google.com/android/devicemanager  on your computer and search through your list of devices that are already connected to your Google account. Once you are there, you can easily send a notification to the phone you want to enable remote password application and wiping upon.

ADM comes with a set of features that helps you to unlock your Android phone as well. It not only helps you to find your device, but also Ring it, lock it, and wipe and erase all the data as well, if your phone is lost or stolen. Once you’re logged into the ADM website from your computer, you can avail all these options once your phone is located. It is a wise option to get your device locked by Android Device Manager in case it is lost or stolen, so that your phone is secured.

Android Device Manager can unlock your phone under a specific set of circumstances only.

- • First of all, Android Device Manager needs to be enabled on your phone before it is lost, stolen, etc.
- • Secondly, your phone can only be tracked by ADM if the GPS option is switched on.
- • Thirdly, the Motorola Moto G23 device you are using for ADM, must be connected to Wi-Fi or internet, to login to your Google account.
- • Lastly, Android Device Manager is not compatible for all Android versions. For now, it is only compatible with devices running Android 4.4 and above, so your phone must be in this category for ADM to work.

## Part 2: How to unlock Android phone with Android Device Manager?

Basically, this error message conveys that you will not be able to unlock your phone using Android Device Manager, and this is a flaw on Google’s part, not your phone’s.

**Step 2:** Clear your lock screen application's data.

Clean data off your lock screen app, uninstall it, and then reboot your device to escape safe mode. When you do so, your phone or Android device will unlock.

### 5\. Use ADB (USB required for Android 10 and lower)

- Connect your device to your PC using a USB connector.
- On your PC, open a terminal window (or command prompt).
- Type in the commands given below. Press Enter after each line:

adb shell

album/data/data/com.android.providers.settings/databases

sqlite3 settings.db

update system set value=0 where name='lock\_pattern\_autolock';

update system set value=0 where name='lockscreen.lockedoutpermanently';

.quit

exit

adb reboot

- After your gadget has rebooted, enter the command below:

adb shell

rm/data/framework/gesture.key

exit

adb reboot

- Your phone will reboot. After it reboots and requests a security pattern, you can utilize any pattern, and it will unlock.
