- • Secondly, your phone can only be tracked by ADM if the GPS option is switched on.
- • Thirdly, the Samsung Galaxy S23 FE device you are using for ADM, must be connected to Wi-Fi or internet, to login to your Google account.
- • Lastly, Android Device Manager is not compatible for all Android versions. For now, it is only compatible with devices running Android 4.4 and above, so your phone must be in this category for ADM to work.
