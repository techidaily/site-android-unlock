ADM comes with a set of features that helps you to unlock your Android phone as well. It not only helps you to find your device, but also Ring it, lock it, and wipe and erase all the data as well, if your phone is lost or stolen.

Android Device Manager can unlock your phone under a specific set of circumstances only.

- • Secondly, your phone can only be tracked by ADM if the GPS option is switched on.
- • Thirdly, the Samsung Galaxy S23 Tactical Edition device you are using for ADM, must be connected to Wi-Fi or internet, to login to your Google account.
- • Lastly, Android Device Manager is not compatible for all Android versions. For now, it is only compatible with devices running Android 4.4 and above, so your phone must be in this category for ADM to work.
