What are the top 2 common problems?

Below are the two most common problems faced by Android users during their efforts to disable the feature of screen lock.

**1\. In the Screen Security choice, the None bar can not be chosen.**

Description of the problem: There is a sentence below it stated: "Disabled by administrators, encryption policy or credential storage". All the space of the None option is in white and grey.

Step 2: Continue to tap on the Clear Credentials (Remove all certificates) option. Then next click on the OK button. Wait for some seconds until your Android device has finished the process.

Step 3: To make sure that the previous step has been performed successfully, try looking at the bottom of the drop-down menu. If the Clear Credentials (Remove all certificates) are grey out and can not be selected, then you have managed to do it.

![disable lock screen android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14556833184389.jpg)

It offers step-by-step instructions and clear on-screen prompts to guide you through the unlocking process. Compared to Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (Android), Android Multi Tool is more suitable for tech-savvy users who have experience with command-line tools and are comfortable working with complex software.

One key advantage of Android Multi Tool is its compatibility with a wide range of Android devices. However, it's worth noting that due to its open-source nature, Android Multi Tool may not receive regular updates and bug fixes, which could potentially lead to compatibility issues with newer Android versions.

In terms of customer support, Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (Android) excels. It offers 24/7 customer support through email, live chat, and phone, ensuring that you receive prompt assistance whenever you encounter any issues. Android Multi Tool, being an open-source software, relies on community forums and user-generated content for support, which may not be as reliable or timely.

When it comes to pricing, both Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (Android) and Android Multi Tool offer free trials, allowing you to test their features before making a purchase. Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (Android) offers flexible pricing plans, including a one-time payment option and a yearly subscription.

## Conclusion

If you are looking for a user-friendly and reliable tool to unlock your Android device, Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (Android) is the recommended choice. Its intuitive interface, comprehensive features, and excellent customer support make it a standout option. However, if you are a tech enthusiast who is comfortable working with complex software and prefer an open-source solution, Android Multi Tool can also be a viable option. Ultimately, the choice depends on your technical expertise and personal preferences
