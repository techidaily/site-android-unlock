## Method 1. Google Find My Device (Without Password/Pin/Pattern)

If you're like me, you've probably tried a million different ways to unlock your Oppo phone, only to be frustrated by the results. Luckily, there's an easy way to unlock your Oppo phone using Google's Find My Device feature.

Google will use your location, phone information, and connection log to find your Nokia.

Follow these steps to unlock the Oppo lock screen password without losing data:

- **Step 1**: Sign into your Google account and navigate the Find My Device website.

- **Step 2**: Sign in with your Google account, which you used on your locked Oppo phone.
- **Step 3**: The Android Device Manager dashboard will show your locked Oppo with three options: Ring, Lock, and Erase.
- **Step 4**: Simply click on "Lock".
- **Step 5**: Enter a password that is not your Google account password in the "New Password" field.
- **Step 6**: Type the new password in the "Confirm password" field. This password lock will replace the current lock screen.
- **Step 7**: You can leave the "Recovery message" field empty or type anything in it.
- **Step 8**: Enter another phone number in the "Phone number" field, although this is optional.
- **Step 9**: Choose "Lock" after entering your password and filling out the optional fields if you wish.
- **Step 10**: If the process is successful, you will receive the unlock code within a few seconds.
- **Step 11**: Navigate to the "Screen Settings" menu after unlocking your device.
- **Step 12**: Use a new password; you can use the temporary password if you want.

You can use it to unlock your Oppo if you have activated the Android Device Manager or Google Find My Device before your phone was locked.

- **Step 2**: Press the “Volume down” and “Power key” buttons simultaneously for a few seconds.

- **Step 4**: Release all buttons and keys if you did step 3 correctly. Once you release all buttons, you'll see a dark screen with options.
- **Step 5**: Choose "Wipe data/factory reset" from the menu, using “Volume Up” to scroll up, “Volume Down” to scroll down, and “Power” to select.
- **Step 6**: From the Android Recovery screen, select the “Yes” option by pressing the “Volume Down” button and the “Power” key.
