Factory Reset Protection (FRP) is a security feature built into Android devices running Android 5.1 Lollipop and later versions.

FRP automatically activates when you add a Google account to your Android phone. It links the HTC U23 device to your account, making it the ‚Äútrusted owner.‚Äù Once activated, FRP becomes embedded in the phone‚Äôs system.

While Google FRP is a valuable security feature, it‚Äôs vital to acknowledge that there are legitimate situations where bypassing it might be necessary. These instances include forgotten Google account credentials, buying a second-hand device, and device issues.
