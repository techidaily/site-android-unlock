## Rootjunky APK To Bypass Google FRP Lock For Lava Storm 5G 

Factory Reset Protection (FRP) is a security feature built into Android devices running Android 5.1 Lollipop and later versions. It prevents someone from using your phone after a factory data reset without Google account login credentials. The FRP makes it much less attractive for thieves to steal Android phones, knowing they will need help to access them.

FRP automatically activates when you add a Google account to your Android phone. It links the Lava Storm 5G device to your account, making it the “trusted owner.” Once activated, FRP becomes embedded in the phone’s system.

While Google FRP is a valuable security feature, it’s vital to acknowledge that there are legitimate situations where bypassing it might be necessary. These instances include forgotten Google account credentials, buying a second-hand device, and device issues. In these cases, tools like **RootJunky** can help you [<u>bypass FRP Lock</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/google-frp-unlock/bypass-frp-with-computer.html). We’ll explore how to use **RootJunky APK** later, but first, let’s define what it is and its role in FRP bypass.

## How to Unlock Lava Storm 5G  PIN Code/Pattern Lock/Password

_I have forgotten the pattern, PIN, or password needed to unlock my Lava Storm 5G  smartphone. What should I do?_

This article will discuss 5 different ways on how to unlock **Lava Storm 5G  smartphone**. Some methods might work without erasing your data, while others, like factory resetting, may erase all content from your phone. Regardless of which method you use, you will be able to unlock your phone! So, let’s get started!

## 1\. How to Unlock Lava Storm 5G  With Google Find My Lava Storm 5G?

A way to unlock the Lava Storm 5G  phone is via Google Find My Device feature. While this method can help unlock your phone, it erases all content from it.

For this method, you need a PC and your Google account details. Here are the steps for it:

**Step 1:** Open your browser and go to [Google Find My Device](https://www.google.com/android/find) on your PC.

![google account verification](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/05/google-account-verification.jpg)

**Step 2:** Log in to the Google account you used to set up your Lava Storm 5G  phone.

 And then select “**Erase Device.**”

Selecting this option will erase all content from your device, including screen unlock PIN, password, and pattern.

**Step 4:** Now, you can access your phone without an unlock PIN or pattern and set a new one.

Use this method only if your phone is backed up so you can restore all your data later.

## 2\. How to Unlock Android device Using Lock Remove Tool?

### Using Google Account Details

Almost all Android smartphones, including Lava Storm 5G , require you to enter your Google account details when setting up your phone for the first time. This account comes in handy later on in situations where your phone is lost or stolen or if you’re switching to another phone. However, it can also help with basic issues like unlocking your phone in case you forget your Lava Storm 5G  screen unlock PIN, pattern, or password. But to use this method successfully, you need to remember the email address bound to the Lava Storm 5G device and its password.

- **Step 1:** Enter the incorrect PIN, pattern, or password 5 times, and click on “Forgot Password” or “Forgot Pattern.”

- **Step 3:** This will unlock your phone. You can now reset the screen unlock PIN, password, or pattern.

If you don't remember your Google account details, you can still unlock your Lava Storm 5G  phone using a third-party tool.

### Using Security Question

Another way to unlock your Lava Storm 5G  phone using Google is by answering the security question. When we set up our Google account, we usually choose a security question and an answer.

Hard resetting your smartphone usually solves everything! Hence, it can also help you unlock your Lava Storm 5G  phone; however, using this method will erase all the data on your phone. So, if you still want to unlock Lava Storm 5G  phone using this method, only do so if you have backed up your device and have no other way to unlock your phone. This includes forgetting your Google account details or not having access to a PC to download and use Dr Fone - Screen Unlock (Android).

Here are the steps for it:

- **Step 1:** Power off your Lava Storm 5G  phone.
- **Step 2:** Press and hold the power and volume down button until the Sony screen appears.

## How to Remove Operator Lock on Lava Storm 5G ?

An operator lock, also called a carrier lock, constitutes a limitation imposed on a mobile phone by a network provider. This measure is implemented to guarantee that the Lava Storm 5G device exclusively functions with the services provided by that specific carrier. If you wish to remove the operator lock from your Lava Storm 5G  device, you'll need to follow specific steps and meet certain criteria. Here's how to remove the operator lock on a Lava Storm 5G :

**Step 1:** Begin by checking whether your device can be unlocked or not from its network carrier restrictions. To do that, you need to dial the code “\*#\*#7378423#\*#\*” on your device, tap “Service Info” and select “SIM Lock.”

![dial the provided number](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/10/unlock-sony-xperia-pin-code-5.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

**Step 2:** Carefully check the information provided on the screen. If there is "X" before the "Network" option and the number in front of it is larger than 0, it means your device can be unlocked. If the number in front of "Network" is 0, your device can't be unlocked as it is hard-locked.

![check the network status](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/10/unlock-sony-xperia-pin-code-6.jpg)

**Step 3:** The next step involves getting your device’s IMEI number. To accomplish this task, simply input "\*#06#" on your device. Once you have the IMEI number, use a reliable service from the internet to the unlocking code. Insert the SIM card of another network and provide the code you gained to unlock your Lava Storm 5G  device.

**Step 1:** To start with the process, verify the bootloader status for your Sony smartphone. On opening the "Dialer" app, dial the number "\*#\*#7378423#\*#\*" and access the "Rooting Status" option within the "Service Provider" settings.
