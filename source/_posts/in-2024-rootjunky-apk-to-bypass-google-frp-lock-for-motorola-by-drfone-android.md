## Rootjunky APK To Bypass Google FRP Lock For Motorola G24 Power 

Factory Reset Protection (FRP) is a security feature built into Android devices running Android 5.1 Lollipop and later versions. It prevents someone from using your phone after a factory data reset without Google account login credentials. The FRP makes it much less attractive for thieves to steal Android phones, knowing they will need help to access them.

FRP automatically activates when you add a Google account to your Android phone. It links the Motorola G24 Power device to your account, making it the “trusted owner.” Once activated, FRP becomes embedded in the phone’s system.

While Google FRP is a valuable security feature, it’s vital to acknowledge that there are legitimate situations where bypassing it might be necessary. These instances include forgotten Google account credentials, buying a second-hand device, and device issues. In these cases, tools like **RootJunky** can help you [<u>bypass FRP Lock</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/google-frp-unlock/bypass-frp-with-computer.html). We’ll explore how to use **RootJunky APK** later, but first, let’s define what it is and its role in FRP bypass.

The **RootJunky APK** is a free Android application also called RootJunky SDL or **RootJunky FRP** Bypass tool. This app’s primary function is to bypass the Google Account FRP lock on Samsung devices.

You can complete this process using the app by connecting your phone to a computer through an OTG cable. **RootJunky** can be helpfu l if you’ve forgotten your Google account password or bought a second-hand phone locked to someone else’s account. However, only use it if you have legitimate reasons to bypass FRP lock, like accessing your device after forgetting your Google account details.

## How to Unlock a Network Locked Motorola G24 Power Phone?

Revolutions in the telecommunication industry have introduced advancements in smartphone features and utilities. The other side of the coin is, however, not as appealing. Thanks to the different carrier services, network locking is the commonest issue of recent mobile launches. Users have reported of Motorola G24 Power phones refusing to work with different carriers.

The issue limits the smartphone's functioning to the specific carrier from whom the Motorola G24 Power device is purchased. Consequently, there are annoying connectivity problems that restrict seamless mobile usage. The problem aggravates in geo-restricted regions where the carrier options are quite limited. This scenario puts forward the need for **Motorola G24 Power network unlock** solutions.

## Part 1: What Does It Mean When Your Motorola G24 Power Phone is Network Locked?

In the simplest words, a network-locked Motorola G24 Power phone means that your device has become carrier-specific. It will now work only with the network provider from where the phone was purchased. Another problem is that there is no automatic unlocking even after the expiry of your contract with the carrier service. Having a network-locked Motorola G24 Power phone poses undesired connectivity issues.

### 1\. Why is my phone locked to the network carrier?

Smartphones are network locked by carrier services to prevent customers from switching to a different carrier. Reasons for switching can be the availability of better plans, discounts, etc. Another cause of locking the phones to specific carriers is preventing them from theft and unauthorized usage.
