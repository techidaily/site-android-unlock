## Rootjunky APK To Bypass Google FRP Lock For Vivo S17 

Factory Reset Protection (FRP) is a security feature built into Android devices running Android 5.1 Lollipop and later versions. It prevents someone from using your phone after a factory data reset without Google account login credentials. The FRP makes it much less attractive for thieves to steal Android phones, knowing they will need help to access them.

FRP automatically activates when you add a Google account to your Android phone. It links the Vivo S17 device to your account, making it the “trusted owner.” Once activated, FRP becomes embedded in the phone’s system.

While Google FRP is a valuable security feature, it’s vital to acknowledge that there are legitimate situations where bypassing it might be necessary. These instances include forgotten Google account credentials, buying a second-hand device, and device issues. In these cases, tools like **RootJunky** can help you [<u>bypass FRP Lock</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/google-frp-unlock/bypass-frp-with-computer.html). We’ll explore how to use **RootJunky APK** later, but first, let’s define what it is and its role in FRP bypass.

The **RootJunky APK** is a free Android application also called RootJunky SDL or **RootJunky FRP** Bypass tool.

You can complete this process using the app by connecting your phone to a computer through an OTG cable. **RootJunky** can be helpfu l if you’ve forgotten your Google account password or bought a second-hand phone locked to someone else’s account. However, only use it if you have legitimate reasons to bypass FRP lock, like accessing your device after forgetting your Google account details.

## How to Unlock Vivo S17  with Google Account?

Almost all Android smartphones, including Vivo S17 , require you to enter your Google account details when setting up your phone for the first time. This includes the email, password, and security question. These details come in handy later on in situations where your phone is lost or stolen or if you’re switching to another phone. However, they can also help with basic issues like unlocking your phone in case you forget your Vivo S17  screen unlock PIN, pattern, or password.

You can unlock your Vivo S17  phone with Google Account in the following two ways:

### Using Google Account Details

Almost all Android smartphones, including Vivo S17 , require you to enter your Google account details when setting up your phone for the first time. This account comes in handy later on in situations where your phone is lost or stolen or if you’re switching to another phone. However, it can also help with basic issues like unlocking your phone in case you forget your Vivo S17  screen unlock PIN, pattern, or password. But to use this method successfully, you need to remember the email address bound to the Vivo S17 device and its password.

Here's how to unlock the Vivo S17  pattern lock without losing data using your Google account:

- **Step 1:** Enter the incorrect PIN, pattern, or password 5 times, and click on “Forgot Password” or “Forgot Pattern.”

If you don't remember your Google account details, you can still unlock your Vivo S17  phone using a third-party tool.

For the latter, here are the steps:

- **Step 1:** Enter the incorrect PIN or pattern to unlock your screen several times till you see the “Forgot Pattern” or “Forgot Password” option. Click on it.
- **Step 2:** Now select the “Answer Security Question” option and type in the answer.

## How to Remove Operator Lock on Vivo S17 ?

An operator lock, also called a carrier lock, constitutes a limitation imposed on a mobile phone by a network provider. This measure is implemented to guarantee that the Vivo S17 device exclusively functions with the services provided by that specific carrier. If you wish to remove the operator lock from your Vivo S17  device, you'll need to follow specific steps and meet certain criteria. Here's how to remove the operator lock on a Vivo S17 :

**Step 1:** Begin by checking whether your device can be unlocked or not from its network carrier restrictions. To do that, you need to dial the code “\*#\*#7378423#\*#\*” on your device, tap “Service Info” and select “SIM Lock.”

![dial the provided number](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/10/unlock-sony-xperia-pin-code-5.jpg)

**Step 2:** Carefully check the information provided on the screen. If there is "X" before the "Network" option and the number in front of it is larger than 0, it means your device can be unlocked. If the number in front of "Network" is 0, your device can't be unlocked as it is hard-locked.
