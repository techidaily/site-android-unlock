## Still Using Pattern Locks with Huawei Nova Y71? Tips, Tricks and Helpful Advice

They have been along for a long, long time now – pattern locks – the easiest of all smartphone locks. You just swipe your finger across to create an **easy pattern lock** of your choosing and that’s it, it becomes your new screen lock. No more remembering tedious digits! So, why have these easy pattern locks become outdated, and why do people still continue to use them? Let’s take a dive and find out all about pattern locks.

![creating more secure pattern locks](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/09/easy-pattern-lock-1.jpg)

## Part I: Things To Know About Pattern Locks

The first cellphone locks were 4-digit number locks. Then came 6-digit codes, and even alphanumeric ones. Pattern locks were all the rage a while ago. Though pattern locks continue to be used, they are not considered safe to use any longer. What is all that about? Here’s what you need to know about pattern locks, whether you are a seasoned pattern lock user or not.

### I.I: What Are Pattern Locks?

Believe it or not, technology has advanced at such a rapid pace in the last two decades that you’d be forgiven if you don’t know what a pattern lock is, especially if you have only ever used iPhones, or Android phones in just the last few years.

Pattern locks are patterns you create on your smartphone and designate as a smartphone lock/ screen lock. There is a 9-point keypad of sorts, and you start swiping your finger from any point to any point for any which way you feel like. Android 13 allows a minimum of 4 points registered. They are easy to create, and easy to use, hence called easy pattern locks.

Pattern locks have only ever been offered on Android devices and were commonplace a few years ago until they were deemed not secure enough for use by modern standards because they were _easy_ to figure out by malicious actors.

### I.II: Popularity and Usage

Pattern lock is a feature unique to Android and has been so since the start. Naturally, it is one of the preferred ways users have come to unlock their Android devices over the years. Even though modern Android smartphones come with fingerprint recognition and face recognition technologies, there exists a large subset of users still addicted to and acclimatized with the pattern lock feature, opting over fingerprint and face recognition.

There has been, however, research conducted into the safety and security offered by pattern lock in Android.

### I.III: Advantages and Drawbacks

Modern smartphones very nearly contain the entirety of our lives; photo memories, video memories, important documents both financial and personal in nature, banking apps, ID and ATM/ credit cards in the “wallet” apps, and whatnot. A smartphone falling into the wrong hands could very nearly be used to devastate the rightful owner, both financially and otherwise. And this is not a claim out of thin air; spyware/ malware/ phishing attacks are on the rise around the world. Locking the smartphone, once considered optional and an unnecessary hassle, is now an absolute must.

#### Advantages of Pattern Locks

There is no denying that using an **easy pattern lock** to lock their smartphone seems enough for most users. Swiping your finger across your smartphone to unlock it feels not only cool and futuristic but safer and more secure than remembering and punching in digits. And, for the most part, it is true, given that 4-digit PINs can only have 10,000 unique combinations!

#### Disadvantages of Pattern Locks

While very easy to use, security researchers and experts have come to agree that the feature is not in the least safe to use, and that is because of how people use the pattern lock feature (discussed in detail below in part II). Some go so far as to say that most pattern locks can be breached in just 5 attempts or less. Imagine that!

What is more, research has found that humans have an uncanny ability to correctly guess a pattern lock simply by viewing the unlocking! The test comprised showing the test subjects videos of users unlocking their phones from different angles and varying distances, and it was found that around 64% of test subjects were able to correctly guess a 6-point pattern lock in one viewing only, and 80% could correctly guess the pattern after just two viewings. By contrast, only 11% were able to correctly deduce a 6-digit PIN after one viewing, and only 27% after viewing twice. This goes to show just how insecure pattern locks are!

## Part II: How People Use Pattern Locks

We might wonder how anyone would be able to guess the correct pattern of our device, but believe it or not, it is possible, eerily easily at that! We are all the same humans, after all! You know how people usually set PINs that could be significant dates in their lives? How they get car registration numbers that mean something to them? The same ‘logic’ applies to their setting pattern locks.

At DEFCON 23, Marte Loge, an M.Sc. Computer Science student, presented something that stunned people around the world. She said, “Tell me who you are, and I will tell you your lock pattern.” What followed was an expert presentation outlining and detailing user behaviors around pattern locks.

These are some commonly created pattern locks by people:

- \- shapes of alphabets,
- \- shapes of numerals,
- \- any other easy-to-make, simple shape.

Marte Loge presented the image below, showing how people naturally gravitate towards creating simple shape patterns, in her research.

![common pattern locks](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/09/easy-pattern-lock-2.jpg)

To further help you see how easy it might be for anyone to guess your pattern, Marte Loge also presented some statistics.

- \- 77% of people started their patterns in one of the 4 corners.
- \- 44% of Loge’s subjects started their pattern with the first dot, the top-left one. The next number was 15% for the top-right and 14% for the bottom-left.
- \- These percentages did not vary much depending on left-handedness or right-handedness.
- \- On average, irrespective of gender, people set 5-point patterns, with 4-point patterns being the most common. This means that the number of combinations on average was 7152 for 5-point patterns and a bogglingly low 1624 for 4-point patterns.

The above data makes it amply clear how using an **easy pattern lock** is actually worse than using a 4-digit PIN, simply because how people are usually using the pattern lock feature.

## Part III: Tips For Using More Secure Pattern Locks

Now, we know how hard it is to break habits cemented over years of use, so in case you must at all costs use a pattern lock only, the least you can do is try and change your easy pattern lock to a better, more secure hard pattern lock.

#### III.I: How to Create More Secure Patterns

Here are some tips to help you create a better, more secure pattern lock for your smartphone.

- \- Avoid using any of the corners to start the pattern.
- \- Never use your first initial as a pattern.
- \- Never use a digit shape as a pattern.
- \- You can pass through the same pattern lines multiple times over. This makes it more difficult for someone to guess your pattern correctly.
- \- Use all 9 points on the grid while setting the pattern lock! That simple act takes the possible pattern combinations to over 140,000, significantly more than 10,000 for 4-digit PINs, and vastly superior to paltry 1624 for a 4-point **easy pattern lock**!

#### III.II: Forgot Your Pattern? Unlock Your Huawei Nova Y71 Without Pattern Lock With Dr.Fone

Supercharged with the information above, you went ahead and changed your easy pattern lock to a hard-to-guess pattern lock. Only problem is, your brain is habituated to that old pattern, and you’ve suddenly forgotten what the new pattern was!

## Closing Words

Pattern locks are outdated and not safe to use an **easy pattern lock** – there are no two ways about it.

In case you forgot your pattern, there is always Wondershare Dr.Fone – Screen Unlock (Android) to save the day.




## How To Fix OEM Unlock Missing on Huawei Nova Y71?

Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) Unlock is a function on Android devices. It allows you to unlock your phone bootloader. A bootloader or bootstrap loader gathers the operating system files, loads them into memory, and hands over control, essentially starting your device. Unlocking the bootloader assists you in installing custom ROMs, flashing custom kernels, and rooting your phone.

However, this freedom comes with some trade-offs. Most manufacturers will void your warranty if you unlock the bootloader, and it can also make your phone face higher risks of malware and other security threats. Additionally, it can be difficult to relock the bootloader once you unlock it.

If you encounter the **OEM unlock missing** on your Android phone despite wanting to unlock your bootloader, this article can help. You will learn the step-by-step guide for the different methods to fix the **missing OEM unlock** option. Before diving into solutions, let's explore why this option might be unavailable in the first place.

## Part 1: Why Is OEM Unlock Missing on Your Device?

Finding that OEM Unlock is missing on your Android phones can be frustrating, particularly if you plan to modify your software or install a custom ROM. But don't worry. There are several possible explanations for this. Let's explore some of the most common reasons:

Manufacturer Restrictions

The **Missing OEM Unlock** option can often be due to restrictions imposed by your device's manufacturers. They may intentionally remove this option to safeguard device security and compatibility. It is common with carrier-locked devices. As a result, the OEM Unlock option may not show.

Bootloader Already Unlocked

In some cases, the **Android OEM Unlock Missing** issue arises [<u>when the bootloader has already been unlocked</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/how-to-unlock-xiaomi-bootloader.html). Relocking the bootloader might make the option reappear. But exercise caution as this process can erase device data.

![oem unlock option greyed out](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/oem-unlock-missing-02.jpg)

Developer Options Not Enabled

It might seem obvious, but sometimes the simplest things get overlooked. The OEM Unlock option can only be accessed from within Developer Options. If this menu isn't enabled, you won't see it.

Carrier-Locked Devices

The **OEM Unlock Missing** issue can also occur if your device is [<u>carrier-locked</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/sim-unlock/carrier-unlock-android-phone.html). Carriers often impose restrictions to prevent users from switching networks, and bootloader unlocking is one way to do that. Unfortunately, the **missing OEM Unlock** option is usually intentional, and unlocking your device can be more complicated.

Security Features

Enhanced security features, like Samsung's KNOX, can sometimes conceal the OEM Unlock option. Temporarily turning off these features might show the option, but it's crucial to be aware of the potential security implications of doing so.

Corrupted Bootloader

A corrupted bootloader can also lead to the **Android OEM Unlock missing** problem. The bootloader plays a role in the boot process, and if it's damaged, it might not display the necessary options. This can be caused by software glitches, failed flashing attempts, or even [<u>hardware issues</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/device-diagnostics/how-to-run-a-hardware-test-on-xiaomi.html). In this scenario, you might need to consult your device's manufacturer or a technical specialist to help repair or re-flash the bootloader.

Connectivity Issues

A poor connection between your device and computer can also prevent the OEM Unlocking from showing up. Check your cables and try using different USB ports to ensure a stable connection.

## Part 2: How To Enable Missing OEM Unlock Without a Password?

Unlocking your phone's bootloader (OEM Unlock) varies across models and brands. Some need a passcode or PIN after rebooting the phone, while others don't. Even if your phone doesn't require a separate password, your existing screen lock (password, PIN, pattern) will usually be needed to enable the **missing OEM unlock** option.

But what if you forgot that, too? [<u>Wondershare Dr.Fone</u>](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/) - Screen Unlock can help bypass forgotten passwords and unlock your phone even if you don't have the technical knowledge.

## Part 3: How To Enable OEM Unlock Missing From the Developer Options?

Developer Options, a hidden menu in Android, offers advanced features like app debugging and custom ROM installation. But if the Android OEM unlock option is missing, you can't unlock your device's bootloader. Below is a step-by-step guide for you so the **OEM unlock missing** option will show in the Developer Options. Remember, this process may erase your device data, so a complete backup is essential before proceeding.

- **Step 1:** Open the **Settings** app on your Android phone.
- **Step 2:** Navigate to **About Phone** at the bottom of the list, then tap **Software information**.

![software information settings](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/oem-unlock-missing-08.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
- **Step 3:** Tap on the **Build number** repeatedly (7 times) until you see a message saying, "**You are now a developer!**" or similar.
- **Step 4:** Go back to **Settings** \> **System** and find the **Developer options** menu.
- **Step 5:** Scroll down and tap the toggle switch next to **Enable OEM Unlock** to turn it on.

![enable oem unlock developer option](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/oem-unlock-missing-09.jpg)

- **Step 6:** A warning message explaining the risks of turning on the OEM unlock will appear. Read it carefully and tap **Enable** if you want to proceed.

![turn on oem unlock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/oem-unlock-missing-10.jpg)

- **Step 7:** Enter your PIN or password to confirm the unlock when prompted
- **Step 8:** Your device will reboot, and OEM Unlocking will be enabled.

## Part 4: How To Fix OEM Unlock Missing by Adjusting Date and Time?

Some manufacturers intentionally delay the availability of the OEM unlock after a software update for security reasons. Changing the date to a past date before the update rolled out can trick the system into displaying the option, as it thinks the update hasn't happened yet. It is a temporary fix, and the option will likely disappear again later when the Huawei Nova Y71 device automatically syncs the correct date.

If you intend to try this method, follow these steps to **enable OEM unlock missing** or greyed out after an Android update:

- **Step 1:** Open the **Settings** app.
- **Step 2:** Go to **System** or **General management**, depending on your Android version.
- **Step 3:** Tap on **Date and Time**.
- **Step 4:** Turn off **Automatic date and time**.

![turn off automatic date and time](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/oem-unlock-missing-11.jpg)

- **Step 5:** Tap on **Set date** and choose the desired older date from the calendar.
- **Step 6:** Tap on **Set time** and choose the desired time from the clock.
- **Step 7:** Tap on **Done** to save the changes.
- **Step 8:** Go back to the **Developers options** and turn off the **Auto update system** option.

![turn off auto update system](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/oem-unlock-missing-12.jpg)

- **Step 9:** Go to **Settings** > **Software update**, then turn off **Auto download over Wi-Fi**.

## Part 5: How To Fix OEM Unlock Missing by Removing SIM Card?

- **Step 1:** Use the SIM ejector tool (often included with your phone) or a small pin to push the tray out.
- **Step 2:** Go to **Settings** > **General Management** > **Reset**, then select **Factory data reset**. Enter your PIN or password if needed.

![android factory data reset](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/oem-unlock-missing-14.jpg)

- **Step 3:** Review the warning and tap **Reset** to confirm.

## 5 Solutions For Huawei Nova Y71  Unlock Without Password

### 1: Lock Types

Before we move towards the **Huawei Nova Y71  pattern unlock**, let's talk about its lock types and security system. Huawei Nova Y71  is one of the older versions of Huawei  android phones that was released in 2016. At that time, only flagship phones from each brand came with features like fingerprint sensors and facial unlock. Huawei Nova Y71  doesn't offer these lock types. You can only set up a screen lock as a password, pattern, and PIN. You can also lock apps on Huawei Nova Y71  with its privacy password settings.

### 2: How to Set Them up?

Follow these steps to set up any type of lock on your Huawei Nova Y71  .

- Open “Settings” on your mobile and select "Lockscreen and Password".
- The lock system menu would appear if your device had no screen locks. If your device has a screen lock, you will have to enter the password to enter the settings.
- Select the "Lockscreen Password" option at the top and tap on the "Enable Lock Screen" button.
- Select the type of lock you want to set and create a password.

### 3: How to Remove Them with Password or Pattern?

You can easily remove the lock screen of your Huawei Nova Y71  if you remember your password or pattern.

- Go to “Settings” and follow the previous steps to open the "Lockscreen Password" settings.
- Disable the lock screen by tapping on the "Enable Lock Screen" button once.
- Enter your password or pattern and wait for the system to remove the screen lock.

## Part 2: 5 Solutions to Unlock Huawei Nova Y71  Without Password or Pattern

### 1: Google Find My Device

You can use the Google Find My Device for your **Huawei Nova Y71  pattern unlock**. It is a simple privacy and security Google feature that enables users to reset their android phones.

With a hard reset, you lose all your data and settings. It is not worth it if all you want to do is unlock your screen. Here are the steps to unlock Huawei Nova Y71  with Find My Device.

### 4: Hard Reset (data loss)

A hard reset would be the best solution if you forgot your phone's lock screen password or pattern. However, you can unlock your phone with your Google account as well. Do a hard reset if you can't remember your Google account password and don't want to use third-party tools. The only problem with hard resetting is that you lose all your data, images, files, settings, and personalization. That is why you can't recover any of your data after the hard reset if you don't have a data backup. The process of hard reset is different for every device. Here are the steps for **Huawei Nova Y71  pattern unlock without a PC** through a hard reset.

- Switch off your Huawei Nova Y71  with the power button.
