### 4\. Dirty Phone or Sensor

#### Problem

Accumulated dirt, dust, or residue on the phone or fingerprint sensor can cause obstruction. This can lead to the failure to properly recognize your fingerprint.

#### Solution

##### 1\. Cleaning the Phone

Employ a gentle, dry microfiber cloth for wiping down the complete surface of your Pixel device. Take particular care to thoroughly clean the region surrounding the fingerprint sensor. Refrain from utilizing rough substances or strong chemicals as they could potentially cause harm to the Samsung Galaxy M14 4G device.

##### 2\. Fingerprint Sensor Cleaning

Gently wipe the fingerprint sensor area using a clean, dry cloth to ensure thorough cleaning. For better results, consider using a dampened cotton swab with water or isopropyl alcohol. Before using it again, ensure the sensor is entirely dry.

##### 3\. Compressed Air or Soft Brush

Use compressed air or a soft brush if there's visible debris or particles around the sensor. Be cautious not to apply excessive pressure that might damage the sensor.

![dirty sensor or phone issue](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/pixel-7-fingerprint-not-working-8.jpg)

### 5\. Screen Protector: Dirty or Damaged

#### Problem

A smudged or impaired screen protector might disrupt the working of the fingerprint sensor. This can potentially cause it to fail to recognize your fingerprint.

#### Solution

##### 1\. Clean the Screen Protector

Start by effectively cleaning the screen protector on your Pixel device. For a thorough cleaning, consider utilizing a screen cleaning solution. Ensure that the screen protector is free from any dirt or debris.

##### 2\. Replace Damaged Protectors

Is the screen protector visibly damaged, scratched, or peeling off? If yes, consider replacing it with a new one. Damaged protectors can hinder fingerprint recognition and compromise device protection.

##### 3\. Check Compatibility

Ensure the screen protector is designed to be compatible with fingerprint sensors. Some protectors may obstruct or interfere with the sensor's functionality.

##### 4\. Remove Air Bubbles
