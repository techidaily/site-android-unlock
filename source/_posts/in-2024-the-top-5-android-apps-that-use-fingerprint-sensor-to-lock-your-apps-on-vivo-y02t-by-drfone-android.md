### How To Locate a Smartphone Using Google Earth

Many current smartphones include GPS receivers that allow them to pinpoint their exact location. If you know the phone's GPS coordinates, you can plug them into Google Earth to see where it is on the map.

- **Step 1:** This process won't be possible if your location services are not enabled on your phone. To do this, navigate to **Settings,** then **Location** on Android, and **Settings** > **Privacy** > **Location Services** on iOS.

![iphone location services](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/09/track-imei-number-through-google-earth-02.jpg)

- **Step 2:** Google Earth can be downloaded and installed on your computer or mobile device. It works with Windows, macOS, Android, and iOS. Download it from your device's **Google Earth** website or the app store.

![install google earth android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/09/track-imei-number-through-google-earth-03.jpg)

- **Step 3:** Sign in to Google Earth using the Google Account linked to the phone you want to track. This step is required to acquire location data and [monitor IMEI numbers](https://drfone.wondershare.com/android-unlock/check-imei-number-location.html) using Google Earth.
- **Step 4:** Launch Google Earth on your computer or mobile device, then select **Your timeline** from the Google Maps menu. The operation will take you to the Google Maps Timeline page.

- **Step 5:** Select the day you wish to see the phone's location history. Choose the Vivo Y02T device you want to track from the dropdown menu if you have numerous devices linked to the same account. The timeline displays the selected device's location history for the set date. Examine the locations visited, the routes taken, and the time spent at each spot. For further information, select a certain location or time.

![google maps location history](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/09/track-imei-number-through-google-earth-05.jpg)

**Note:** Google Earth does not support real-time location tracking by default. You can use the **Find My Device** function on Android or **Find My** on iOS instead if you want to track your phone's real-time location.

### Pros and Cons of IMEI Trackers: Apps and Online Platforms

Now that you know there are still methods to track a phone using an IMEI number, it's also important to weigh their pros and cons. See the list presented below:

**Pros**

Check out the advantages of using IMEI trackers below:

- **Lost or Stolen Device Recovery.**The primary benefit of an IMEI tracker is its ability to help locate a lost or stolen mobile device. That can be crucial for recovering your valuable device.
- **No Need for Special Apps.**Unlike many other tracking methods, IMEI tracking doesn't require any special apps or software to be installed on the Vivo Y02T device you want to track. It relies on the unique IMEI number of the Vivo Y02T device.
- IMEI Tracker is compatible with many mobile devices, including smartphones and feature phones. It's not limited to a specific operating system or brand.

**Cons**

Below are the drawbacks of using IMEI trackers:

- **Privacy Concerns.**IMEI tracking can raise privacy concerns, as it involves tracking the location of a mobile device. It's essential to use this technology responsibly and only for legitimate purposes.
- **Internet and Network Dependency.**IMEI tracking depends on the Vivo Y02T device being connected to the internet or a mobile network. If the Vivo Y02T device is turned off, in airplane mode, or disconnected, tracking may be impossible.
- **Inaccuracies in Remote Areas.**IMEI tracking can be less accurate or even unavailable in remote or rural areas with poor network coverage.

In summary, an IMEI tracker can be a valuable tool for locating lost or stolen mobile devices with its location accuracy and compatibility with various devices. However, it comes with limitations related to privacy and network dependency.
