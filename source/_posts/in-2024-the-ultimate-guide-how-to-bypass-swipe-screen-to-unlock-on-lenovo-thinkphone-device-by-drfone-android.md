## Part 1. Synopsis: Things To Know Before Deleting Gmail Account

Although the process of deleting a Gmail account sounds basic, there are many pointers connected to it. For that, this part is putting up a discussion on the important things that a user should know before they **delete their Gmail account permanently:**

- **No Going Back:** If you delete a Gmail account, the process is irreversible. All details and information will be lost, and the email won't be trackable ever again.
- **Cannot Reset Passwords if Connected:** If the Gmail account is connected to any other service, make sure that you remember their passwords. Since the account will be deleted, you cannot reset their passwords.
- **Access to Other Services:** Although you are deleting your Gmail account, you can still access Google Photos, Google Drive, and other services.
- **Lookout For Emails:** Ensure that the emails in your account are saved. You can easily download them anywhere before deleting the Gmail account.

## Part 2. Delete Your Gmail Account Using Your Password: Desktop Solution

For the first method, we will discuss **how to delete a Google account** with your password. You will use your computer for this process and access the [Google Account](https://myaccount.google.com/) services. The service helps you save all your essential Gmail data before you remove it. To understand how it makes it possible, look through the steps provided below:

- **Step 1.** Access the website [https://myaccount.google.com/](https://myaccount.google.com/) on your desktop browser and log in with your credentials. Proceed to the “Data & privacy” section from the left panel.
