### 1: Lock Types

Before we move towards the **Meizu 21  pattern unlock**, let's talk about its lock types and security system. Meizu 21  is one of the older versions of Meizu  android phones that was released in 2016. At that time, only flagship phones from each brand came with features like fingerprint sensors and facial unlock. Meizu 21  doesn't offer these lock types. You can only set up a screen lock as a password, pattern, and PIN. You can also lock apps on Meizu 21  with its privacy password settings.

Here are the steps for **Meizu 21  pattern unlock without a PC** through a hard reset.
