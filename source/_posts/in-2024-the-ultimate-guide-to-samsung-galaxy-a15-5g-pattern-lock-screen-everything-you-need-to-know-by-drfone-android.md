Do you want to revamp your phone’s pattern lock screen and give it a new life? Well, you are not the only one! Lots of Android users keep looking for numerous ways to change their screen lock pattern and make it more secure. After all, if your lock screen pattern is strong, then it will certainly keep an intruder away. In today’s world, our privacy is everything and we should take every needed measure to protect it. To help you do the same, we have come up with this informative guide. Read on and learn how to set up a strong pattern lock screen on your device and what to do if you have forgotten it.

## Part 1: How to set up Pattern Lock Screen on Samsung Galaxy A15 5G?

Out of all the provided options for screen locks, pattern lock is mostly used due to its ease of access and added security. If you haven’t set up a screen lock pattern on your device, then we recommend you to do the same right away. Not only will it keep intruders away, it will also protect your privacy. To learn how to set up a lock screen pattern on an Android device, simply follow these steps:

- 1\. Firstly, unlock your device and go to its Settings. You can access it from the Home Screen or from its Notification Center.
- 2\. Under the personal or privacy section, you can access the “Lock Screen and Security” option.
- 3\. In some versions, the option is also listed right at the top of the settings (in its quick access).

- 4\. To set up a pattern lock screen, tap on the “Screen lock type” feature.
- 5\. This will provide a list of all the different kinds of locks that you can apply. Ideally, it would be password, pin, pattern, swipe, or none. In “Swipe”, you can unlock a device just by swiping the screen. Whereas, in pattern, pin, or password, you would be needed to provide the respective pattern/pin/password to unlock the Samsung Galaxy A15 5G device.
- 6\. We recommend setting up a lock screen pattern instead. To do this, tap on the “Pattern” option.

- 7\. From the next screen, you can simply draw any kind of pattern of your choice. Ideally, it should join at least 4 dots on the screen. We recommend using a strong screen lock pattern to provide unmatched security to your device.
- 8\. Furthermore, you need to confirm your choice and provide the same pattern once again. Make sure that you draw the same pattern here.
- 9\. Additionally, the interface will ask you to provide a security pin as well. In case if you will forget your pattern, then you can access your phone by taking the assistance of this pin.

![setup android pattern lock screen](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/09/15057380143598.jpg) ![setup android pattern lock screen-provide the same pattern](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/09/15057380317550.jpg) ![setup android pattern lock screen-provide a security pin](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/09/15057380506350.jpg)

- 10\. Similarly, you would be required to confirm the pin as well to finish the setup.
- 11\. That’s it! By completing these steps, a screen lock pattern will be implemented on your device.

Later, you can follow the same drill to change your device’s lock screen pattern as well. Though, you would be needed to provide the existing pattern to access these features. Out of all the lock screen options, you should go with the pattern lock. Not only it is the most accessible option, it also provides fast results with an added security.

## Part 2: What to do if you forget Android pattern lock?

After following the above-mentioned tutorial, you would be able to set up a pattern lock screen on your device. Since it is recommended to have a strong pattern lock, users often forget their pattern lock after implementing it. This prohibits them from using their own Android device.

- **Step 6.** After the reset, select "reboot system now" and tap the Power/Side button to restart your device.
- **Step 7.** Your phone will now be unlocked, and the password will be removed.

## Way 6. Unlock Samsung Phone with Samsung's Find My Mobile

## FAQs About Android Unlock

### 1\. Is there any universal code to unlock the Android phone?

No, there is no universal code for unlocking Android phones. They are different from stable SIM pins. Due to mobile device security, only users themselves can set up a unique password on their Android phone. So, it’s impossible to unlock an Android phone with a so-called universal code.

### 2\. How to reset your Android phone password after the unlock?

- **Step 1:** Open your Samsung phone and go to the Settings menu.
- **Step 2:** Select the Lock Screen and Security options.
- **Step 3:** Select Screen Lock Type.
- **Step 4:** Select the Password option.
- **Step 5:** Enter your current password, then tap Continue.
- **Step 6:** Enter your new password twice, then tap OK.
- **Step 7:** Your new password will now be in effect.

### 3\. Don’t you have face or fingerprint unlock? Let’s set them up.  

- **Step 1:** Go to the Settings app on your Samsung phone.
- **Step 2:** Tap on the "Lock Screen" option.
- **Step 3:** Select "Screen Lock Type."
- **Step 4:** Choose the "Fingerprints" or "Face unlock" option.
- **Step 5:** Follow the instructions on your screen to set up the desired unlock feature.
- **Step 6:** When you're finished, you'll be able to unlock your phone using either your fingerprint or your face.

### 4\. How to unlock an Android phone without data loss?

There are several ways how to [unlock Android phones without data loss](https://drfone.wondershare.com/guide/android-lock-screen-removal.html). One of the most recommended ways is that you can set up the method to unlock with a fingerprint or face. Because it has an official guarantee, and you don’t need professional skills. Moreover, if your phone has Android version 4.0 or even older, unlocking your phone via "Forgot Pattern' will also help you finish the goal.

The methods discussed above in Way 1 or [Way 2](https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/forgot-android-password.html#Part2) can guide you better into unlocking your device using this tool.
