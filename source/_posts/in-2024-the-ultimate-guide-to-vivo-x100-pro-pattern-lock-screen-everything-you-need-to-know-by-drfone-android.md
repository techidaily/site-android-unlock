Neither less to say, in order for the step to work properly, you need your Gmail account to be properly configured with the Vivo X100 Pro device.

**Step 1: Attempt Passwords**

At first, you need to make five attempts to unlock your device. Whether you have used a PIN or Pattern lock, Android will always give you five attempts to get the password right. Once you get that, it will trigger the “Forget Password/Pattern” option on Your Vivo X100 Pro. This way, you can sneak back into the system once again.
