## Tips and Tricks for Setting Up your Gionee F3 Pro Phone Pattern Lock

Failing to remember the **pattern lock** of a phone is one of the most puzzling situations for Android users. Unlike the famous OS, Android gives a seamless method to eliminate the issue.

You can attempt the methods below or an expert tool if you have forgotten the **pattern lock** on your gadget and reset it.

So, keep following us to unlock the **lock screen pattern** and use your phone again.

## Part 1: What Is Android Pattern?

A **pattern lock** is used to identify the actual user by your Android phone. It is a widely used phone locking system and a secured one. Simply put, a pattern lock includes a line pattern you choose that you can draw to unlock a lock screen. You can enable this lock screen feature from the security menu in the settings application.

So, if you have set a **pattern lock** as a screen lock for your device, you will need to draw the exact pattern every time you log in.

## Part 2: Best Tool to Unlock Your Pattern

## Conclusion

This article explored the incredible world of IMEI tracking, a powerful tool for locating lost or stolen phones. You've learned that your IMEI number is capable of helping you pinpoint your device's location, but **tracking IMEI numbers through Google Earth** is impossible.

But that's not all. This article also introduced and divulged an amazing and reliable tool for unlocking an iPhone. So, the next time you're in a tight spot with a locked screen, remember that [Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/iphone-unlock/) is the best software you should get your hands on.

## How to Bypass Android Lock Screen Using Emergency Call On Gionee F3 Pro?

The main reason why we keep our smartphone locked is to prevent children (or stalkers) checking out our private photos or messages. You don't want anyone to access your pictures, emails, or other important data. What if you forget your pattern or PIN and cannot access your phone? Or someone changes lock screen pattern to leave you annoyed?

To avoid such types of conditions, we have tried and tested the following methods to bypass the Gionee lock screen pattern, PIN, password, and fingerprint.

## Method 1. Use 'Find My Mobile' feature on Gionee Phone

All Gionee devices come with the "Find My Mobile" feature. To bypass the Gionee lock screen pattern, PIN, password, and fingerprint, you can just follow the below steps to get it done.

- Step 1. First, set up your Gionee account and log in.
- Step 2. Click the "Lock My Screen" button.
- Step 3. Enter a new PIN in the first field
- Step 4. Click the "Lock" button at the bottom
- Step 5. Within a few minutes, it will change the lock screen password to the PIN so that you can unlock your device.

## Method 4. 'Pattern Password Disable' and Custom Recovery (SD Card needed)

To bypass the Gionee lock screen in this method, you ought to be an advanced user who knows what are "custom recovery" and "rooting". You have to install any kind of customer recovery, and you should have an SD card on your phone.

## Method 5. Delete the Password File Using ADB

It is yet another option that will work only when you have enabled USB Debugging previously on your device, and your PC is allowed to connect via ADB. If you meet such requirements, it is ideal to use this method to unlock the Gionee lock screen.

- Step 1. Connect your device to the PC using USB cable and open command prompt in the adb directory. Type the command "adb shell rm /data/system/gesture.key" and then press "Enter".
- Step 2. Restart your phone, and a secure lock screen must be gone, and you can access your device. Be sure to set a new PIN, pattern, or password before rebooting again.
