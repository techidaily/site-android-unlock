## Tips and Tricks for Setting Up your HTC U23 Pro Phone Pattern Lock

Failing to remember the **pattern lock** of a phone is one of the most puzzling situations for Android users. Unlike the famous OS, Android gives a seamless method to eliminate the issue.

You can attempt the methods below or an expert tool if you have forgotten the **pattern lock** on your gadget and reset it. However, we suggest you try Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock for a quick and safe solution. To make things more straightforward, we have given you other techniques as a workaround to the issue.

So, keep following us to unlock the **lock screen pattern** and use your phone again.

## Part 1: What Is Android Pattern?

A **pattern lock** is used to identify the actual user by your Android phone. It is a widely used phone locking system and a secured one. Simply put, a pattern lock includes a line pattern you choose that you can draw to unlock a lock screen. You can enable this lock screen feature from the security menu in the settings application.

So, if you have set a **pattern lock** as a screen lock for your device, you will need to draw the exact pattern every time you log in.

## Part 2: Best Tool to Unlock Your Pattern

### Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock

The most effective and quick tool to unlock a **pattern lock** is Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock by Wondershare. Dr.Fone is an all-in-one tool for all your Android needs and has been in the business for a long time. We suggest you use Dr.Fone. The following steps will help you unlock your device:

**Step 1.** Select the "Screen Unlock" option in the Dr.Fone interface.

![screen unlock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png)

**Step 2. Select Unlock Android Screen**

To unlock the pattern lock on your device, the “Unlock Android Screen” will guide you to finish the whole process.

**Step 3. Select unlock mode**

If you click “Remove without Data Loss,” only some limited Samsung or LG phone models can be unlocked without losing data. To unlock most phone brands' screens, “100% Remove Screen Lock” is a better choice.

## 7.Next Lock Screen

Next Lock Screen is a cross platform unlock app that's compatible with the complete Android ecosystem, making it one of the most valuable unlock apps for Android on the market. As a Microsoft product, it likes to advertise some of their other applications but this feature can thankfully be turned off. The notifications are clearly Microsoft quality which is not necessarily something that can be said about your average Android unlock screen app.

How to unlock : Pin,swipe or pattern.

![unlock apps for android-Next Lock Screen](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/next-lock-screen.jpg)

## 8.AcDisplay

AcDisplay comes with a rather minimalistic look similar to some of the most popular web site creator services like Squarespace or Wix. The home screen will highlight notifications for which it will offer two options, either you swipe down in which case you will ignore the notification, or swipe anywhere else and the lock screen will unlock. What's really great about this Android unlock app is the fact that it can use your device's sensors, allowing it to detect its placement therefore whether or not it should be on or off.

Google Play link: [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.achep.acdisplay&hl=en](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.achep.acdisplay&hl=en)

How to unlock : You can swipe anywhere on the screen.
