## Part 1: Lock System About Lava Blaze Pro 5G  

### 1: Lock Types

Before we move towards the **Lava Blaze Pro 5G  pattern unlock**, let's talk about its lock types and security system.

You can only set up a screen lock as a password, pattern, and PIN. You can also lock apps on Lava Blaze Pro 5G  with its privacy password settings.

Here are the steps for **Lava Blaze Pro 5G  pattern unlock without a PC** through a hard reset.
