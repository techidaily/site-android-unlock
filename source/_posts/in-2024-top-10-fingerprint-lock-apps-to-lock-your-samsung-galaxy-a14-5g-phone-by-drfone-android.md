You need to log into the Google account that is associated with the Samsung Galaxy A14 5G device, then do the following:

- The unlock pattern may only be used five times before a notification telling you to try again in 30 seconds appears.
- "Forgot pattern" will show up at the bottom of the screen.

- That's it; from this point forward, you may enter any new PIN or pattern that you can recall to unlock your smartphone.

### 2\. Google Find My Device

Using your Google account is a superb method for finding the Samsung Galaxy A14 5G device when lost or stolen.

In addition, it may be used to lock or ring your smartphone. You may have noticed that there are three options available when using this feature: "Ring," "Lock," and "Erase."

To bypass the Android lock screen, all you need to do is sign into the Samsung Galaxy A14 5G device's associated Google account and then follow these steps:

- On any Android device or a computer, go to <www.google.com/android/find> and sign in using your Google account. Choose the Android smartphone you wish to unlock after that.
- After choosing the Samsung Galaxy A14 5G device, select one of the three options, "lock," from the list.

Many Samsung customers have this issue, which prevents them from using their devices. Try using the "Find My Mobile" feature on your mobile if you wish to unlock it if you're a Samsung user. It would be helpful if you had a Samsung or Android model account.

After that, use Find My Device to unlock your Android phone without losing any data by following the instructions below:

### 3\. Use ADB (Android Debug Bridge)

- Launch the installer after that to begin downloading crucial software for your machine.

![launch the adb installer to unlock android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/howt-to-unlock-your-phone-without-password-6.jpg)

When your phone is locked, you may access the recovery menu of your phone using its physical keys and choose to hard reset the Samsung Galaxy A14 5G device. Here's how to restore a locked phone to factory settings.

- Use the buttons to see the recovery menu.
- Press and hold the Volume Up and Side buttons simultaneously until you see the brand logo on the screen for Android devices without a Power/Bixby/Home button.

It offers step-by-step instructions and clear on-screen prompts to guide you through the unlocking process. Compared to Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (Android), Android Multi Tool is more suitable for tech-savvy users who have experience with command-line tools and are comfortable working with complex software.

One key advantage of Android Multi Tool is its compatibility with a wide range of Android devices. However, it's worth noting that due to its open-source nature, Android Multi Tool may not receive regular updates and bug fixes, which could potentially lead to compatibility issues with newer Android versions.

In terms of customer support, Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (Android) excels. It offers 24/7 customer support through email, live chat, and phone, ensuring that you receive prompt assistance whenever you encounter any issues. Android Multi Tool, being an open-source software, relies on community forums and user-generated content for support, which may not be as reliable or timely.

When it comes to pricing, both Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (Android) and Android Multi Tool offer free trials, allowing you to test their features before making a purchase. Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (Android) offers flexible pricing plans, including a one-time payment option and a yearly subscription.

If you are looking for a user-friendly and reliable tool to unlock your Android device, Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (Android) is the recommended choice.
