**Swipe:**

You can unlock your phone by swiping in any direction on its screen.

**Pattern:**

You will draw a pattern on a 3-by-3 grid of dots to unlock your phone this way. To do this, you'll need to use your finger to connect the dots in the pattern.

**Phone Pin:**

When you choose a PIN, make sure it's something easy to remember. But choose wisely- a PIN that's too easy to guess can put your account at risk.

**Password:**

It is the highest level of security available for your phone. Passwords should contain seven characters, of which at least one must be a letter. They should also be both unique and memorable.

**Face recognition:**

By holding your face directly in front of the phone screen, you can unlock your phone and verify yourself in apps.

**Fingerprints:**

Touch your phone to open it quickly and easily.

**Iris:**

Verify that only the contents of your phone are visible to your eyes.

## 10 Easy-to-Use FRP Bypass Tools for Unlocking Google Accounts On Samsung Galaxy S23

FRP, popularly known as the Factory Reset Protection program, is an additional data protection feature for all Android users. As per the FRP feature, in any unfortunate event wherein you lose the Samsung Galaxy S23 device or if any unauthorized person tries to reset it, the Samsung Galaxy S23 device will require the Google Account ID and password to be fed in.
