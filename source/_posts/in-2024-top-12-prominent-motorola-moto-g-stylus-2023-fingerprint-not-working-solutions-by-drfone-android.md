This tool temporarily supports bypassing Android screens without data loss on Samsung and LG. As for other Android phones, all the data will disappear after unlocking with this tool.

The features of this Dr.Fone software are many. It gives a solution to four lock methods: a pin, pattern, fingerprint, and password. It is user-friendly, and even a user with no technical information can also use it with no issue. This tool is only limited to remove the screen lock on Samsung and LG without losing data. Your data will still be wiped out on other Android phones after using this tool.
