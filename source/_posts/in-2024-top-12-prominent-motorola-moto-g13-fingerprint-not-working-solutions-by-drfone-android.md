### 6\. Clean Your Finger

#### Problem

The problem may lie with your fingers rather than the Motorola Moto G13 device. Unclean or moist fingers can hinder accurate fingerprint recognition on the sensor, causing **the Motorola Moto G13 fingerprint sensor to not work**.

#### Solution

##### 1\. Cleanse and Dry Your Hands

Remove any dirt, oil, or moisture that might cause issues with the fingerprint sensor. It's crucial to wash and thoroughly dry your hands.

#### Solution

##### 1\. Avoid Covering the Sensor Area

Be cautious while cleaning the screen to avoid covering or smudging the area around the fingerprint sensor. Precise cleaning around this area prevents interference with sensor functionality.

##### 2\. Use Proper Holding Technique

While holding the Motorola Moto G13 device, avoid placing your fingers or palms over the fingerprint sensor. Opt for holding the Motorola Moto G13 device to minimize accidental contact with the sensor area.
