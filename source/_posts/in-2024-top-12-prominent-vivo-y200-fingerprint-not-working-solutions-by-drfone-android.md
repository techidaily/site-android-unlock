Now see how to unlock your lock screen in different ways.

### 1.Slide

This is the most common method of unlocking an android lock screen. On all most all the android device, you'll notice a lock mostly on the right side (sometimes on top) of a round charm. You just have to direct towards the lock and then the lock screen will be unlocked in no time. This method doesn't provide any security (it just protects your device from sudden access by tapping on screen or any of the button) to your device as no password or PIN is required to set the "Slide" unlock.

![android lock screen settings](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/android-lock-screen-settings-3.jpg)

Keep your any finger on the middle of the round charm and by keeping your finger pressed, reach on the lock icon. The lock screen will be unlocked just after reaching your finger to the lock icon.

### 2.Face Unlock

This method of unlocking your lock screen needs your Android device to snap a photo of your with its camera. After you set the snapped photo as the unlocking recognition, you could unlock your device through showing your face on the screen.

Capture a picture of your face with your Android device's camera and then set it for logging in into your device. From the lock screen, by just by holding your face, you can log in. It's very interesting, but you should never rely on this method for strong security as this method of unlocking is prone to break easily as an intruder can unlock your device by putting a photo of you in front of your device. Moreover, this method sometimes doesn't work properly. So it's better to go for some other highly secured options for locking your screen.

### 3.Pattern

This is a way of setting pattern for lock screen from a grid of nine dots. You can select the pattern like some letter like Z, L or C etc, but nothing guarantees high security as the set pattern can be easily guessed or be seen while you are unlocking your device. Another problem is that by unlocking with the same pattern, your finger leaves some marks for the pattern's path. By following the path, a stranger can unlock your device. So for little security, you can use pattern unlock method on your Android device.

![android lock screen settings](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/android-lock-screen-settings-5.jpg)

Go to the lock screen setting for Pattern and then set the pattern by sliding your finger from one dot to another, then another and like that way. Remember which pattern you've set in order to unlock your device in the next time.

### 4.PIN

You might be troubled by thinking about the difference between PIN and Password. A little distinction is there for a PIN and that is it consists of numbers only whereas for password, you can associate some alphabetical letters or signs along with numbers.

### 5.Password

In addition to PIN protection, you can consider it as password by adding some letters, special characters with the previously selected PIN codes. It's also very much highly protected method of locking screen though you might be bored with tapping for the password again and again. But never ignore the value of your device's files, so a password can be a well-sought lock screen protection for many users.

## Part 3: Other ways to Unlock Pattern for Android

There are other ways to unlock the **universal unlock patterns** for Android. We have mentioned some of them below.

### Way 1: Remove Gesture File Using ADB

The first method is ADB, which stands for Android Debug Bridge. With the help of this, you can unlock your Android's **[universal unlock pattern](https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/unlock-iphone-without-passcode.html)** without the need of a factory reset. However, the process may seem a bit time-consuming to you. Here is how you can do it.

**Step 1**: Open your PC and head to [Android Developer's site](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb.html). Download ADB now.

**Step 2**: Launch it now and install the packages on your PC.

**Step 3**: Connect your Android to PC now. Before that, make sure to enable USB Debugging. If you don't know-how, simply head to the "Settings"> “About Phone” and tap on “Build Number” 7 times. This will enable the Developer's Options.

**Step 5**: After connecting Android to PC, you need to open the command prompt in the installation directory.

**Step 6**: Run the following command and press Enter key: `adb shell rm /data/system/gesture.key`

### Way 2: Boot into Safe Mode to Bypass Third-Party App Screen Lock

It's one of the most straightforward ways to get past the lock screen. One thing to note is that this method is effective only if the lock screen is a third-party app rather than the standard one.

**Step 1**: Firstly, long-press the Power button to get the power menu.

**Step 2**: Now, long tap the "Power Off" button and click "OK" when shown the pop-up.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

**Step 3**: This will restart your device in safe mode.

**Step 4**: This will turn off the third-party lock screen for the time being. Clear the lock screen app's data, uninstall it, and then reboot to exit safe mode.

### Way 3: Unlock Pattern Lock via Factory Reset

This should only be a last option because it will completely delete your device's data and saved settings. Your device will be reset to factory settings, meaning your device's settings will get back to the same as when you first bought it. If you want to learn how to [unlock a pattern](https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/samsung-unlock-codes.html) by doing a factory reset, follow these steps:

**Step 1**: Long press the Home, Power and Volume Up keys to Recovery Mode.

Please note that the Recovery mode method may vary from device to device. So please ensure to check the key combination before you do it.

**Step 2**: Now go to the "wipe data/factory reset" option using the volume keys. To confirm it, press the Power key.

**Step 3**: Now, again, confirm the process using the same keys.

![unlock android screen 14](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/12/factory-reset-2.jpg)

**Step 4**: The phone will perform the factory reset. In a short while, restart your device and there will be no lock screen.

### Way 4: Unlock Pattern Lock with Android Device Manager

Android Device Manager unlocking is the second-best service for bypassing the Android lock screen on locked Android devices and tablets. Working on this service is quite straightforward, and it only works if the user has a Google account. This service is accessible and usable from any device or computer.

There are a few things to keep in mind as you use this service to get around the lock screen. If the Android device is compatible, the Android Device Manager will connect it after a few tries. After it has been connected to the Vivo Y200 device, we can begin by pressing the "Lock" button.

After pressing the "Lock" button, a popup will appear, asking for a new password to replace the forgotten pin, pattern, or password.

![unlock android screen 16](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/12/android-device-manager-2.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

Type the new password once, then confirm it by typing it again. This will change the password in a few minutes and the new password can be used to unlock the Vivo Y200 device.

### Way 5: Use Forgot Pattern Feature \[Android 4.4 Version and Earlier\]

If you use an older Android version, you can get rid of the **universal unlock pattern** by forgot pattern feature. On earlier Android devices, this feature is enabled by default. After a few failed attempts, the warning "Try again in 30 seconds" appears and here is where the steps begin. Let us get to know in detail.

**Step 1**: Simply enter wrong pattern too many times until try again in 30 seconds warning comes.

**Step 2**: Select the "Forgot Pattern" option below the message.
