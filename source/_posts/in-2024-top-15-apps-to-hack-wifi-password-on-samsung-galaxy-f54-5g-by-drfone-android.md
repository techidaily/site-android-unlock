This [WiFi Analyzer](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.farproc.wifi.analyzer&hl=en&gl=US) app helps you find the best WiFi channels for your network, improving your signal strength and allowing you to hack passwords easily. This process involves using a WiFi analyzer app to scan for nearby wireless networks, analyze their signal strength, and identify potential vulnerabilities. The app then attempts to exploit these weaknesses and gain access to the network's password. While this approach may seem like an easy way to access a password-protected WiFi network, it is important to note that hacking into someone else's network without their permission is illegal and can lead to serious legal consequences.

**Steps to usage:**

- **Step 5.** Once enough packets are captured, enter the command "aircrack-ng -w \[path to wordlist\] -b \[target BSSID\] \[path to capture file\]" to crack the password.
- **Step 6.** The password will be displayed on the screen once it is successfully cracked.li>

**Pros:**

- Easy to use and user-friendly interface.
- Can help identify weak spots in your own WiFi network.
