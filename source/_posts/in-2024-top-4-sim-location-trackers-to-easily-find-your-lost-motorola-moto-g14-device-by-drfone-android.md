To learn how to set up a lock screen pattern on an Android device, simply follow these steps:

- 1\. Firstly, unlock your device and go to its Settings. You can access it from the Home Screen or from its Notification Center.
- 2\. Under the personal or privacy section, you can access the “Lock Screen and Security” option.
- 3\. In some versions, the option is also listed right at the top of the settings (in its quick access).

## Method 3: Factory Reset Motorola Moto G14  Phones (Wipes User Data)

There is a standard factory reset built into every Motorola Moto G14  phone to allow users to erase the Motorola Moto G14 device and start over fully. This option wipes all user data and resets the phone to how you received it in the box. Naturally, this is not a preferred way, as it requires the phone to be set up all over again and that takes time. Also, all data will need to be backed up beforehand in order to restore it again. Overall, this method consumes a lot of time.

**Step 1:** Go to Settings > Backup & Reset.

**Step 2:** Tap Factory Reset > Reset Phone.

**Step 3:** Tap Erase Everything.

## Method 4: Use Google Find My Device To Unlock Motorola Moto G14  Phones (Wipes User Data)

Google Find My Device is an online service by Google that is used to locate and track your Android devices. It works like how Apple's Find My works for its range of hardware. Using Find My Device, you can play a sound on the Motorola Moto G14 device to locate it in the house if you have misplaced it, lock the phone in case it is lost, and wipe the Motorola Moto G14 device remotely.

**Step 1:** Go to <https://accounts.google.com>.

**Step 2:** Log in and go to Security > Your Devices:

## Bonus Tip: If You Want To Disable Screen Lock
