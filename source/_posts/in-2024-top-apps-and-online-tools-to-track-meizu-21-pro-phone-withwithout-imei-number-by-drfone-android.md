## Solution 3: Unlock the Meizu Phone Using Google Login (only Android 4.4 and below)

If your Meizu device runs on Android 4.4 and previous versions, then you can easily move past the password/pattern lock without any trouble. The provision is not available on devices, which run on newer versions of Android. Nevertheless, for all the Meizu 21 Pro devices running on older versions than Android 4.4, this is undoubtedly the easiest way to set a new passcode. Follow these steps to learn how to unlock your Meizu phone if you forgot your password using your Google credentials.

- **Step 1.** Try bypassing the pattern lock at least 5 times. After all the failed attempts, you will get the option to either make an emergency call or choose the option of “**Forget pattern**”.

![unlock lg forgot password - forgot pattern](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/03/14892203178747.jpg)

- **Step 2.** Select the “Forget pattern” option and provide the correct credentials of your Google account to unlock your phone.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## Solution 4: Unlock the Meizu Phone Using Custom Recovery (SD card needed)

If your phone has a removable SD card, you can also try this technique to disable the pattern/password on your device. Though, you need to have some custom recovery installed on your device for this method. You can always go for TWRP (Team Win Recovery Project) and flash it on your device.

TWRP: <https://twrp.me/>

Also, since you can't move anything to your device when it is locked, you need to do the same using its SD card. After ensuring that you have met all the basic prerequisites, follow these steps and learn how to unlock the Meizu phone's forgotten password using a custom recovery.

- **Step 1.** Download a [Pattern Password Disable](http://forum.xda-developers.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=2532214&d=1390399283) application and save its ZIP file on your computer. Now, insert your SD card into your system and move the recently downloaded file to it.

- **Step 2.** Reboot your phone into recovery mode. For instance, the TWRP recovery mode can be turned on by simultaneously pressing the Power, Home, and Volume Up button. You would get different options on your screen after entering the custom recovery mode. Tap on “Install” and browse the Pattern Password Disable application file.

## Solution 5: Factory Reset Meizu Phone in Recovery Mode (erases all phone data)

- **Step 1.** Put your Meizu phone on its recovery mode with correct key combinations. To do this, firstly, turn your device off and let it rest for a few seconds. Now, press the Power and Volume Down key at the same time. Keep pressing them until you see LG's logo on the screen. Release the buttons for a few seconds and press them again at the same time. Again, keep pressing the buttons until you see the recovery mode menu. This technique works with most Meizu devices, but it can differ slightly from one model to another.

- **Step 2.** Choose “Wipe Data/Factory Reset.” You can use the Volume up and down key to navigate the options and the power/home key to select anything.
