However, the process may seem a bit time-consuming to you. Here is how you can do it.

In regular mode, restart the phone. The pattern will be requested. However, any pattern will unlock the screen.

### Way 2: Boot into Safe Mode to Bypass Third-Party App Screen Lock

It's one of the most straightforward ways to get past the lock screen. One thing to note is that this method is effective only if the lock screen is a third-party app rather than the standard one.

**Step 1**: Firstly, long-press the Power button to get the power menu.

**Step 2**: Now, long tap the "Power Off" button and click "OK" when shown the pop-up.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

**Step 3**: This will restart your device in safe mode.

**Step 4**: This will turn off the third-party lock screen for the time being. Clear the lock screen app's data, uninstall it, and then reboot to exit safe mode.

### Way 3: Unlock Pattern Lock via Factory Reset

This should only be a last option because it will completely delete your device's data and saved settings. Your device will be reset to factory settings, meaning your device's settings will get back to the same as when you first bought it. If you want to learn how to [unlock a pattern](https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/samsung-unlock-codes.html) by doing a factory reset, follow these steps:

**Step 1**: Long press the Home, Power and Volume Up keys to Recovery Mode.

**Step 2**: Now go to the "wipe data/factory reset" option using the volume keys. To confirm it, press the Power key.

### Way 4: Unlock Pattern Lock with Android Device Manager

Android Device Manager unlocking is the second-best service for bypassing the Android lock screen on locked Android devices and tablets. Working on this service is quite straightforward, and it only works if the user has a Google account. This service is accessible and usable from any device or computer.

![unlock android screen 15](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/12/android-device-manager-1.jpg)

There are a few things to keep in mind as you use this service to get around the lock screen. If the Android device is compatible, the Android Device Manager will connect it after a few tries. After it has been connected to the Lenovo ThinkPhone device, we can begin by pressing the "Lock" button.

After pressing the "Lock" button, a popup will appear, asking for a new password to replace the forgotten pin, pattern, or password.

![unlock android screen 16](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/12/android-device-manager-2.jpg)

Type the new password once, then confirm it by typing it again. This will change the password in a few minutes and the new password can be used to unlock the Lenovo ThinkPhone device.

### Way 5: Use Forgot Pattern Feature \[Android 4.4 Version and Earlier\]

If you use an older Android version, you can get rid of the **universal unlock pattern** by forgot pattern feature. On earlier Android devices, this feature is enabled by default. After a few failed attempts, the warning "Try again in 30 seconds" appears and here is where the steps begin. Let us get to know in detail.

**Step 1**: Simply enter wrong pattern too many times until try again in 30 seconds warning comes.

**Step 2**: Select the "Forgot Pattern" option below the message.
