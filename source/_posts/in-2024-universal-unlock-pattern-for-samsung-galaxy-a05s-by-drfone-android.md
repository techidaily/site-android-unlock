Your device will be reset to factory settings, meaning your device's settings will get back to the same as when you first bought it.

With a hard reset, you lose all your data and settings. It is not worth it if all you want to do is unlock your screen. Here are the steps to unlock Samsung Galaxy A05s  with Find My Device.

Every step is easy to follow, and it only takes a few minutes for you to unlock your phone. This method requires your Google account and password. Don't use this method if you don't know your Google password. If you are a beginner, it is better to use other methods because this method involves the risk of blocking your device. Follow these steps to unlock your Samsung  device using your Google Account.

![Samsung Galaxy A05s  lock screen](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/oppo-a37-password-unlock-02.jpg)

You have to answer precisely with proper spaces. Here are the steps to unlock Samsung Galaxy A05s  with security questions.

Do a hard reset if you can't remember your Google account password and don't want to use third-party tools. The only problem with hard resetting is that you lose all your data, images, files, settings, and personalization. That is why you can't recover any of your data after the hard reset if you don't have a data backup. The process of hard reset is different for every device. Here are the steps for **Samsung Galaxy A05s  pattern unlock without a PC** through a hard reset.

- Switch off your Samsung Galaxy A05s  with the power button.
