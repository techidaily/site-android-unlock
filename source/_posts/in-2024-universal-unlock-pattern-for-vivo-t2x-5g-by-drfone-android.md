- **Step 1:** Sign in to the Samsung Knox Portal using administrative credentials.

### Rooting and Flashing a New ROM To Remove Knox Enrollment Service

This process involves gaining root access to the Vivo T2x 5G device’s operating system, which allows you to modify the software extensively. After rooting, you can flash a new ROM that doesn’t include the Knox software.
