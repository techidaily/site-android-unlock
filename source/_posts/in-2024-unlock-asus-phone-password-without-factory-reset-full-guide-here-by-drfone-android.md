**Step 1:** You may already have entered the incorrect pattern a few times. If so, simply tap the Forgot Pattern to start the process of unlocking your Asus ROG Phone 8  phone screen. Else, deliberately enter incorrect pattern a few times till you see the Forgot Pattern option:

Overall, this method consumes a lot of time.

**Step 1:** Go to Settings > Backup & Reset.

**Step 2:** Tap Factory Reset > Reset Phone.

**Step 3:** Tap Erase Everything.

## Method 4: Use Google Find My Device To Unlock Asus ROG Phone 8  Phones (Wipes User Data)

**Step 1:** Go to <https://accounts.google.com>.

## Method 5: Request Service Provider To Unlock Your Asus ROG Phone 8  Phone

You can request your service provider to unlock your Asus ROG Phone 8  phone provided their conditions are met. Usually, they will be happy to oblige if there are no dues and the service period is over.

## Bonus Tip: If You Want To Disable Screen Lock
