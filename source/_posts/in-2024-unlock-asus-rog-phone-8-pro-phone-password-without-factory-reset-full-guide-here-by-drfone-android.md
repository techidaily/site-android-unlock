## Method 1: Unlock Asus ROG Phone 8 Pro  Phones Running Older Android OS (4.4 Or Below) With Google Security Questions

Up until Android version 4.4, you could lock your phone screen with a pattern. Google allowed you to unlock the phone by answering security questions in case you forgot the pattern.

So, if you have an old Asus ROG Phone 8 Pro  with Android 4.4 or earlier, here is **how to unlock Asus ROG Phone 8 Pro  phone password without factory reset**:

**Step 1:** You may already have entered the incorrect pattern a few times. If so, simply tap the Forgot Pattern to start the process of unlocking your Asus ROG Phone 8 Pro  phone screen. Else, deliberately enter incorrect pattern a few times till you see the Forgot Pattern option:

FRP automatically activates when you add a Google account to your Android phone. It links the Asus ROG Phone 8 Pro device to your account, making it the “trusted owner.” Once activated, FRP becomes embedded in the phone’s system.
