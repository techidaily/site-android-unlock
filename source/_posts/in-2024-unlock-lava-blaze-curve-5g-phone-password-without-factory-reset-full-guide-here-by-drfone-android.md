So, if you have an old Lava Blaze Curve 5G  with Android 4.4 or earlier, here is **how to unlock Lava Blaze Curve 5G  phone password without factory reset**:

**Step 1:** You may already have entered the incorrect pattern a few times. If so, simply tap the Forgot Pattern to start the process of unlocking your Lava Blaze Curve 5G  phone screen. Else, deliberately enter incorrect pattern a few times till you see the Forgot Pattern option:

## Why does not Fingerprint Work

### 1\. Fingerprint Hardware Module Problems

The fingerprint module should be clean, just like a clean finger is. Unfortunately, the module would collect liquid from your fingers, especially if you had used a moisturizer earlier, making it difficult for the sensor to read your fingers accurately.

## How to Remove Operator Lock on Lava Blaze Curve 5G ?

An operator lock, also called a carrier lock, constitutes a limitation imposed on a mobile phone by a network provider. This measure is implemented to guarantee that the Lava Blaze Curve 5G device exclusively functions with the services provided by that specific carrier. If you wish to remove the operator lock from your Lava Blaze Curve 5G  device, you'll need to follow specific steps and meet certain criteria.
