## Method 1: Unlock Lava Blaze Curve 5G  Phones Running Older Android OS (4.4 Or Below) With Google Security Questions

Up until Android version 4.4, you could lock your phone screen with a pattern. Google allowed you to unlock the phone by answering security questions in case you forgot the pattern.

So, if you have an old Lava Blaze Curve 5G  with Android 4.4 or earlier, here is **how to unlock Lava Blaze Curve 5G  phone password without factory reset**:

**Step 1:** You may already have entered the incorrect pattern a few times. If so, simply tap the Forgot Pattern to start the process of unlocking your Lava Blaze Curve 5G  phone screen. Else, deliberately enter incorrect pattern a few times till you see the Forgot Pattern option:

## Method 3: Factory Reset Lava Blaze Curve 5G  Phones (Wipes User Data)

There is a standard factory reset built into every Lava Blaze Curve 5G  phone to allow users to erase the Lava Blaze Curve 5G device and start over fully. This option wipes all user data and resets the phone to how you received it in the box. Naturally, this is not a preferred way, as it requires the phone to be set up all over again and that takes time. Also, all data will need to be backed up beforehand in order to restore it again. Overall, this method consumes a lot of time.

**Step 1:** Go to Settings > Backup & Reset.

**Step 2:** Tap Factory Reset > Reset Phone.

**Step 3:** Tap Erase Everything.

## Method 4: Use Google Find My Device To Unlock Lava Blaze Curve 5G  Phones (Wipes User Data)

**Step 1:** Go to <https://accounts.google.com>.

**Step 2:** Log in and go to Security > Your Devices:

![unlock motorola phone with google](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/09/full-guide-to-unlock-motorola-phones-10.jpg)

## Part 1: What Is the Emergency Call Bypass Method?

The **Android emergency call bypass** method is a lesser-known workaround for those unfortunate moments when you’re locked out of your phone. This method exploits a loophole in the phone’s lock screen, allowing you to access your device even when you’ve [<u>forgotten your password, PIN, or pattern</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/9-ways-to-bypass-samsung-lock-screen-pattern-pin-password-fingerprint.html). It’s like finding a secret backdoor when the front door is bolted shut.

**“How can unlocking Vivo, Oppo, and Samsung phones using emergency calls** be effective?” You may ask. Imagine you need to access important information on your phone but can’t remember your lock screen code. Instead of panicking or rushing to a technician, the emergency call bypass can be a quick and handy solution. It’s particularly useful when immediate access to your phone is crucial and you don’t have time to [<u>reset your password </u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/reset-android/how-to-reset-privacy-password-in-oppo.html) through official channels.

### Limitations of the Emergency Call Bypass Method

However, it’s important to note that this method has its limitations. It primarily works on older Android devices, specifically those running Android 5.0 (Lollipop) and below. As smartphone technology has evolved, manufacturers have patched many loopholes to enhance security. So, this method might not work for you if you have a more recent Android version.

But don’t worry – if you’re locked out of a newer phone, you can try several other methods, which you will explore later in this article. Remember, the **emergency call bypass** can be a lifesaver in specific scenarios. However, it’s always best to use such methods responsibly and ethically. And, of course, you should always note your passwords.

## Part 2: How To Perform Emergency Call Bypass To Unlock Screen

Unlocking your Android phone without a password using the Emergency Call Bypass method can be tricky, but it’s doable, especially on devices running Android OS 5.0 (Lollipop) and below. Here’s a step-by-step guide on **how to unlock any phone password using the emergency call** feature:

- **Step 1:** Start by tapping the **Emergency Call** button on your lock screen. This will bring up the emergency dialer screen.

![android tap to add emergency contacts](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/unlock-emergency-call-phone-03.jpg)

- **Step 2:** Type a series of special symbols on the dialer screen, such as asterisks (\*). Do this several times in a row.
- **Step 3:** Double-tap the string of symbols to highlight them, then copy the string. Now, tap on the screen to paste the copied string. Repeat this process 10 to 11 times until you can no longer highlight the series.
- **Step 4:** Go back to the lock screen. Open the **Camera** app by tapping the camera icon or sliding left. Simultaneously, pull down the Notification Panel from the top.
- **Step 5:** In the Notification Panel, tap the gear icon to try and access your device’s settings.
- **Step 6:** When prompted for a password, long-press and paste the copied string into the password field. Repeat this several times until the option to paste is no longer available.
- **Step 7:** Keep pasting the string until the interface crashes. The lock screen should disappear, and the camera interface will expand. After some time, the camera app should also crash, and your device will unlock, displaying the home screen.

## Part 3: Other Ways To Unlock Your Screen

While the **emergency call bypass for Android** method is interesting, it’s largely unreliable and outdated, mainly effective on older Android versions. Modern devices have significantly improved security, making this method obsolete. There are other, more reliable methods for those needing to unlock their phone’s screen.

### Method 3: Forcing a Data Reset on Your Android Phone

As a last resort, you can [<u>perform a factory reset</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/reset-android/how-to-factory-reset-huawei-phone-when-locked.html). This will erase all data on your device but remove the lock screen. Access the recovery mode by pressing a combination of keys (usually volume up/down and the power button) and then selecting **Wipe data/Factory reset**.

### Method 4: Booting Into Safe Mode

Booting into safe mode can bypass third-party lock screens. This method won’t work on the default lock screen but can be helpful if an app sets the lock.

In summary, while the emergency call bypass is a thing of the past, there are still various ways to unlock your phone. There’s always a solution, whether through a sophisticated tool like Wondershare Dr.Fone or built-in Android features.
