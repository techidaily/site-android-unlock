## Method 1: Unlock Lava Yuva 3 Pro  Phones Running Older Android OS (4.4 Or Below) With Google Security Questions

So, if you have an old Lava Yuva 3 Pro  with Android 4.4 or earlier, here is **how to unlock Lava Yuva 3 Pro  phone password without factory reset**:

**Step 1:** You may already have entered the incorrect pattern a few times. If so, simply tap the Forgot Pattern to start the process of unlocking your Lava Yuva 3 Pro  phone screen. Else, deliberately enter incorrect pattern a few times till you see the Forgot Pattern option:
