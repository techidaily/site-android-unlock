## Method 1: Unlock Motorola Moto G23  Phones Running Older Android OS (4.4 Or Below) With Google Security Questions

Up until Android version 4.4, you could lock your phone screen with a pattern. Google allowed you to unlock the phone by answering security questions in case you forgot the pattern. Since these may also be easily guessed by people who are in possession of your device illegally, Google deprecated this method after Android 4.4. However, the phones running Android 4.4 or lower are still allowed to be unlocked using this method. So, if you have an old Motorola Moto G23  with Android 4.4 or earlier, here is **how to unlock Motorola Moto G23  phone password without factory reset**:

**Step 1:** You may already have entered the incorrect pattern a few times. If so, simply tap the Forgot Pattern to start the process of unlocking your Motorola Moto G23  phone screen. Else, deliberately enter incorrect pattern a few times till you see the Forgot Pattern option:

## Method 3: Factory Reset Motorola Moto G23  Phones (Wipes User Data)

There is a standard factory reset built into every Motorola Moto G23  phone to allow users to erase the Motorola Moto G23 device and start over fully. This option wipes all user data and resets the phone to how you received it in the box.

Overall, this method consumes a lot of time.

**Step 1:** Go to Settings > Backup & Reset.

**Step 2:** Tap Factory Reset > Reset Phone.

**Step 3:** Tap Erase Everything.
