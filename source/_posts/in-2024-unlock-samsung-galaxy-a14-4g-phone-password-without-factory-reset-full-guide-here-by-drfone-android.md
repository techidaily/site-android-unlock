## Method 1: Unlock Samsung Galaxy A14 4G  Phones Running Older Android OS (4.4 Or Below) With Google Security Questions

Up until Android version 4.4, you could lock your phone screen with a pattern. Google allowed you to unlock the phone by answering security questions in case you forgot the pattern. Since these may also be easily guessed by people who are in possession of your device illegally, Google deprecated this method after Android 4.4.

So, if you have an old Samsung Galaxy A14 4G  with Android 4.4 or earlier, here is **how to unlock Samsung Galaxy A14 4G  phone password without factory reset**:

**Step 1:** You may already have entered the incorrect pattern a few times. If so, simply tap the Forgot Pattern to start the process of unlocking your Samsung Galaxy A14 4G  phone screen. Else, deliberately enter incorrect pattern a few times till you see the Forgot Pattern option:

## Bonus Tip: If You Want To Disable Screen Lock

This is how to disable screen lock on Android:

**Step 1:** Navigate to Settings > Security > Screen Lock.

**Step 2:** Enter the PIN or pattern.

**Step 3:** Choose None and confirm.
