## Method 1: Unlock Samsung Galaxy A24  Phones Running Older Android OS (4.4 Or Below) With Google Security Questions

Up until Android version 4.4, you could lock your phone screen with a pattern. Google allowed you to unlock the phone by answering security questions in case you forgot the pattern.

**Step 1:** You may already have entered the incorrect pattern a few times. If so, simply tap the Forgot Pattern to start the process of unlocking your Samsung Galaxy A24  phone screen. Else, deliberately enter incorrect pattern a few times till you see the Forgot Pattern option:
