## Method 1: Unlock Samsung Galaxy M34  Phones Running Older Android OS (4.4 Or Below) With Google Security Questions

Up until Android version 4.4, you could lock your phone screen with a pattern. Google allowed you to unlock the phone by answering security questions in case you forgot the pattern. Since these may also be easily guessed by people who are in possession of your device illegally, Google deprecated this method after Android 4.4. However, the phones running Android 4.4 or lower are still allowed to be unlocked using this method. So, if you have an old Samsung Galaxy M34  with Android 4.4 or earlier, here is **how to unlock Samsung Galaxy M34  phone password without factory reset**:

**Step 1:** You may already have entered the incorrect pattern a few times. If so, simply tap the Forgot Pattern to start the process of unlocking your Samsung Galaxy M34  phone screen. Else, deliberately enter incorrect pattern a few times till you see the Forgot Pattern option:

**Step 2:** Next, choose the option to reset the pattern by answering your Google credentials.

**Step 3:** Sign into the Google account that matches with the Google account on the phone.

**Step 4:** Lastly, create a new pattern to unlock your Samsung Galaxy M34  phone.

Start by waking up Google Assistant. You can do this by saying the wake word "Hey Google" or "OK Google." If it doesn’t work, you can long-press the home button or use any dedicated gesture to activate Google Assistant.

- **Step 2:** Issue a Voice Command

Once Google Assistant is active, issue a voice command related to the task you want to perform. For example:

"Hey Google, what's the weather today?"

## Part 3. Common Problems When Using Google Assistant

Unable to use **Google Assistant to unlock phone** is not the only drawback that users may have encountered in recent changes. Although Google Assistant on the lock screen presents a revolutionary way to interact with your phone, like any technology, it also comes with its share of challenges. Some of the common problems when using Google Assistant are:

One prevalent issue users encounter is Google Assistant misunderstanding or misinterpreting voice commands. This can be influenced by factors such as background noise, accent variations, or pronunciation differences.
