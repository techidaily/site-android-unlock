## Method 1: Unlock Sony Xperia 5 V  Phones Running Older Android OS (4.4 Or Below) With Google Security Questions

Up until Android version 4.4, you could lock your phone screen with a pattern. Google allowed you to unlock the phone by answering security questions in case you forgot the pattern.

So, if you have an old Sony Xperia 5 V  with Android 4.4 or earlier, here is **how to unlock Sony Xperia 5 V  phone password without factory reset**:

**Step 1:** You may already have entered the incorrect pattern a few times. If so, simply tap the Forgot Pattern to start the process of unlocking your Sony Xperia 5 V  phone screen. Else, deliberately enter incorrect pattern a few times till you see the Forgot Pattern option:

## Method 3: Factory Reset Sony Xperia 5 V  Phones (Wipes User Data)

Overall, this method consumes a lot of time.

**Step 1:** Go to Settings > Backup & Reset.

### 1\. Contact your carrier

Your carrier can also unlock your voicemail. Get in touch with your carrier and ask for an unlock. For unlocking, your account may need to satisfy certain conditions. The request can take a few days to be processed after you submit it.

Get in touch with your carrier to find out the status of your unlock request.

The actions following should be followed when your carrier certifies that the voicemail has been reset.

- Take your SIM card out.
- Put the new SIM card in. Your gadget will turn on, and you will be able to generate a new voicemail password.

### 2\. Use your code to reset password
