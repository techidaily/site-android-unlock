## Method 3: Factory Reset Vivo S17 Pro  Phones (Wipes User Data)

There is a standard factory reset built into every Vivo S17 Pro  phone to allow users to erase the Vivo S17 Pro device and start over fully. This option wipes all user data and resets the phone to how you received it in the box.

Overall, this method consumes a lot of time.

**Step 1:** Go to Settings > Backup & Reset.

**Step 2:** Tap Factory Reset > Reset Phone.

**Step 3:** Tap Erase Everything.

**Step 1:** Go to <https://accounts.google.com>.
