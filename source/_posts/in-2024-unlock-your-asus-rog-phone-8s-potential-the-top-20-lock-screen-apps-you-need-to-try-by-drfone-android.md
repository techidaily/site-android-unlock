To bypass the Android lock screen, all you need to do is sign into the Asus ROG Phone 8 device's associated Google account and then follow these steps:

Each brand has a unique method for hard resetting a locked Android device. The methods to factory reset locked Android devices from Samsung, LG, HTC, Sony, and Huawei are compiled here.
