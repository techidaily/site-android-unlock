![android lock screen bypassed](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/screen-unlock-any-android-device-6.png)

Now, if you don’t remember your Google account details and don’t have access to a PC to use a screen unlock tool, you can unlock Android phone using the conventional way.

## How to Unlock HTC U23 Pro  with Google Account?

Almost all Android smartphones, including HTC U23 Pro , require you to enter your Google account details when setting up your phone for the first time. This includes the email, password, and security question. These details come in handy later on in situations where your phone is lost or stolen or if you’re switching to another phone. However, they can also help with basic issues like unlocking your phone in case you forget your HTC U23 Pro  screen unlock PIN, pattern, or password.

You can unlock your HTC U23 Pro  phone with Google Account in the following two ways:

- Using Google account details
- Using Google security question

![unlock sony xperia](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/05/how-to-unlock-sony-xperia.png)

### Using Google Account Details

Almost all Android smartphones, including HTC U23 Pro , require you to enter your Google account details when setting up your phone for the first time. This account comes in handy later on in situations where your phone is lost or stolen or if you’re switching to another phone. However, it can also help with basic issues like unlocking your phone in case you forget your HTC U23 Pro  screen unlock PIN, pattern, or password. But to use this method successfully, you need to remember the email address bound to the HTC U23 Pro device and its password.

Here's how to unlock the HTC U23 Pro  pattern lock without losing data using your Google account:

- **Step 1:** Enter the incorrect PIN, pattern, or password 5 times, and click on “Forgot Password” or “Forgot Pattern.”
- **Step 2:** The interface will then ask you to enter your Google account details as an alternate option. Enter the Google account details you used when setting up your HTC U23 Pro  phone.
- **Step 3:** This will unlock your phone. You can now reset the screen unlock PIN, password, or pattern.

If you don't remember your Google account details, you can still unlock your HTC U23 Pro  phone using a third-party tool.

### Using Security Question

Another way to unlock your HTC U23 Pro  phone using Google is by answering the security question. When we set up our Google account, we usually choose a security question and an answer. This comes in handy if you want to recover your Google account, reset the password, or if you want to unlock your phone's screen.

For the latter, here are the steps:

- **Step 1:** Enter the incorrect PIN or pattern to unlock your screen several times till you see the “Forgot Pattern” or “Forgot Password” option. Click on it.
- **Step 2:** Now select the “Answer Security Question” option and type in the answer.
- **Step 3:** Click on “Unlock” after which you will be asked if you want to set a new PIN or pattern. Select “Yes.”
- **Step 4:** Your HTC U23 Pro  phone will be unlocked, and you can set a new PIN or pattern for your screen.

## How to Unlock HTC U23 Pro  by Hard Reset?

Hard resetting your smartphone usually solves everything! Hence, it can also help you unlock your HTC U23 Pro  phone; however, using this method will erase all the data on your phone. So, if you still want to unlock HTC U23 Pro  phone using this method, only do so if you have backed up your device and have no other way to unlock your phone. This includes forgetting your Google account details or not having access to a PC to download and use Dr Fone - Screen Unlock (Android).

Here are the steps for it:

- **Step 1:** Power off your HTC U23 Pro  phone.
- **Step 2:** Press and hold the power and volume down button until the Sony screen appears.
- **Step 3:** The “System Recovery” menu will appear. Use the volume up and down button to scroll to the “Factory Reset” option. Use the power button to select this option.
- **Step 4:** Select “Yes” when asked for confirmation.

Your HTC U23 Pro  phone will be hard reset, and all the locks will be removed. When you turn it on again, you will have to set it up like a new phone using your Google account details.

## How to Remove Operator Lock on HTC U23 Pro ?

An operator lock, also called a carrier lock, constitutes a limitation imposed on a mobile phone by a network provider. This measure is implemented to guarantee that the HTC U23 Pro device exclusively functions with the services provided by that specific carrier. If you wish to remove the operator lock from your HTC U23 Pro  device, you'll need to follow specific steps and meet certain criteria. Here's how to remove the operator lock on a HTC U23 Pro :

**Step 1:** Begin by checking whether your device can be unlocked or not from its network carrier restrictions. To do that, you need to dial the code “\*#\*#7378423#\*#\*” on your device, tap “Service Info” and select “SIM Lock.”

![dial the provided number](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/10/unlock-sony-xperia-pin-code-5.jpg)

**Step 2:** Carefully check the information provided on the screen. If there is "X" before the "Network" option and the number in front of it is larger than 0, it means your device can be unlocked. If the number in front of "Network" is 0, your device can't be unlocked as it is hard-locked.

![check the network status](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/10/unlock-sony-xperia-pin-code-6.jpg)

**Step 3:** The next step involves getting your device’s IMEI number. To accomplish this task, simply input "\*#06#" on your device. Once you have the IMEI number, use a reliable service from the internet to the unlocking code. Insert the SIM card of another network and provide the code you gained to unlock your HTC U23 Pro  device.
