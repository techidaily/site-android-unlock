## Part 1: Lock System About Meizu 21 Pro  

### 1: Lock Types

Before we move towards the **Meizu 21 Pro  pattern unlock**, let's talk about its lock types and security system. Meizu 21 Pro  is one of the older versions of Meizu  android phones that was released in 2016. At that time, only flagship phones from each brand came with features like fingerprint sensors and facial unlock. Meizu 21 Pro  doesn't offer these lock types. You can only set up a screen lock as a password, pattern, and PIN. You can also lock apps on Meizu 21 Pro  with its privacy password settings.

### 1: Google Find My Device

You can use the Google Find My Device for your **Meizu 21 Pro  pattern unlock**. It is a simple privacy and security Google feature that enables users to reset their android phones. Most people use it to factory reset their phones when someone steals their phones. Although Google Find My Device works every time, it is not the ideal solution if you don't want to lose your data. With a hard reset, you lose all your data and settings. It is not worth it if all you want to do is unlock your screen. Here are the steps to unlock Meizu 21 Pro  with Find My Device.

![Meizu 21 Pro  lock screen](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/oppo-a37-password-unlock-02.jpg)

### 4: Hard Reset (data loss)

A hard reset would be the best solution if you forgot your phone's lock screen password or pattern. However, you can unlock your phone with your Google account as well. Do a hard reset if you can't remember your Google account password and don't want to use third-party tools. The only problem with hard resetting is that you lose all your data, images, files, settings, and personalization. That is why you can't recover any of your data after the hard reset if you don't have a data backup. The process of hard reset is different for every device. Here are the steps for **Meizu 21 Pro  pattern unlock without a PC** through a hard reset.

- Switch off your Meizu 21 Pro  with the power button.
