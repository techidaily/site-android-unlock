## Part 5: Unlock locked Oppo Reno 11F 5G  phone with Gmail ID and password

It is imperative to understand that unlocking your Oppo Reno 11F 5G  Phone using a Gmail ID and password should be your last resort and especially if you are using an older version of Android. Among all the tricks of how to reset a Oppo Reno 11F 5G  phone that is locked, it only works if you are running around version 4.4 KitKat or older than that. Neither less to say, in order for the step to work properly, you need your Gmail account to be properly configured with the Oppo Reno 11F 5G device.

**Step 1: Attempt Passwords**

## 7.Next Lock Screen

Next Lock Screen is a cross platform unlock app that's compatible with the complete Android ecosystem, making it one of the most valuable unlock apps for Android on the market.
