Neither less to say, in order for the step to work properly, you need your Gmail account to be properly configured with the Samsung Galaxy F54 5G device.

**Step 1: Attempt Passwords**

At first, you need to make five attempts to unlock your device. Whether you have used a PIN or Pattern lock, Android will always give you five attempts to get the password right. Once you get that, it will trigger the “Forget Password/Pattern” option on Your Samsung Galaxy F54 5G. This way, you can sneak back into the system once again.

**Step 2: Enter Credentials**

Once you hit the option, you will be redirected to another page, where you need to enter your Gmail id and password. Make sure that you get the information right, and select “Sign in.”

Once you get everything right, this will bypass any password or pattern you once had put on your Phone. Just remember, you need to have a stable internet connection in order for the step to work seamlessly.

## Bonus Tip: Are There Preventive Measures To Avoid Future Lockouts?

Want to prevent future lockouts and ensure a smoother smartphone experience? Consider implementing the following preventive measures:

### 1\. Setting Up Alternative Lock Methods

One way to avoid getting locked out of your Samsung Galaxy F54 5G  phone is to set up alternative lock methods. In addition to PINs, passwords, and patterns, you can use biometric methods. These include fingerprint recognition or facial recognition if your device supports them. Such options provide convenient and secure ways to unlock your phone.

### 2\. Regularly Backing Up Your Data

Regular data backups are crucial to safeguarding your essential files and information. Utilize cloud backup services or local backup solutions to routinely save your data. In case of a lockout or a factory reset, you can quickly restore your data without loss.

### 3\. Using Secure and Memorable Passwords

When setting up lock methods, opt for strong, unique, and memorable passwords. Avoid using easily guessable information like birthdays or simple patterns. Strong passwords can enhance security while minimizing the chances of forgetting your credentials.

## Conclusion

There is no point in arguing that looking through how to reset a Samsung Galaxy F54 5G  phone that is locked after you have forgotten the password is indeed a hectic process. But, there is a way around it too. By going through all the steps mentioned above, you can always get an unlocked phone with ease.
