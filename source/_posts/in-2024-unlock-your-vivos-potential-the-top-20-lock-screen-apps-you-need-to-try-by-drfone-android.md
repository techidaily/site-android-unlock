## Part 1: Lock System About Vivo S18e  

### 1: Lock Types

Before we move towards the **Vivo S18e  pattern unlock**, let's talk about its lock types and security system. Vivo S18e  is one of the older versions of Vivo  android phones that was released in 2016. At that time, only flagship phones from each brand came with features like fingerprint sensors and facial unlock. Vivo S18e  doesn't offer these lock types. You can only set up a screen lock as a password, pattern, and PIN. You can also lock apps on Vivo S18e  with its privacy password settings.

### 2: How to Set Them up?

Follow these steps to set up any type of lock on your Vivo S18e  .

- Open “Settings” on your mobile and select "Lockscreen and Password".
- The lock system menu would appear if your device had no screen locks. If your device has a screen lock, you will have to enter the password to enter the settings.
- Select the "Lockscreen Password" option at the top and tap on the "Enable Lock Screen" button.
- Select the type of lock you want to set and create a password.

### 3: How to Remove Them with Password or Pattern?

You can easily remove the lock screen of your Vivo S18e  if you remember your password or pattern.

- Go to “Settings” and follow the previous steps to open the "Lockscreen Password" settings.

You will see various questions if your Google account is linked with the Vivo S18e device. All questions are based on your profile and credentials. You have to answer precisely with proper spaces. Here are the steps to unlock Vivo S18e  with security questions.

![Vivo S18e  forgot pattern interface](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/oppo-a37-password-unlock-03.jpg)

### 4: Hard Reset (data loss)

A hard reset would be the best solution if you forgot your phone's lock screen password or pattern. However, you can unlock your phone with your Google account as well. Do a hard reset if you can't remember your Google account password and don't want to use third-party tools. The only problem with hard resetting is that you lose all your data, images, files, settings, and personalization. That is why you can't recover any of your data after the hard reset if you don't have a data backup. The process of hard reset is different for every device. Here are the steps for **Vivo S18e  pattern unlock without a PC** through a hard reset.

- Switch off your Vivo S18e  with the power button.
