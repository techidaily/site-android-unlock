## 2.Lok Lok

Lok Lok has a unique take on the locking screen application niche, allowing you to send drawings to people who use the same application. It has the basic functions of course but it really is only fan when others you know, use the same app as well. This fact kind of restricts this otherwise excellent application but the idea is genius. An Android unlock screen app that allows your creative side to shine through.

This Android unlock app doesn't allow pin lock screen at the moment, it can be unlocked with the home button

This android unlock app allows pin and pattern unlock, and it also has an intruder alert (the phone locks and takes a photo when somebody unsuccessfully tries to unlock it).

## 6.Semper

This Android unlock app was once called UnlockYourBrain and it is quite unique in the way that it will make you work for your phone time. This may sound ridiculous at first, but actually a very clever idea and naturally emergency numbers can be called at all times.

## 7.Next Lock Screen

Next Lock Screen is a cross platform unlock app that's compatible with the complete Android ecosystem, making it one of the most valuable unlock apps for Android on the market. As a Microsoft product, it likes to advertise some of their other applications but this feature can thankfully be turned off. The notifications are clearly Microsoft quality which is not necessarily something that can be said about your average Android unlock screen app.

How to unlock : Pin,swipe or pattern.

The home screen will highlight notifications for which it will offer two options, either you swipe down in which case you will ignore the notification, or swipe anywhere else and the lock screen will unlock. What's really great about this Android unlock app is the fact that it can use your device's sensors, allowing it to detect its placement therefore whether or not it should be on or off.

It would be unjust to call it an Android unlock app, this application is actually a carefully selected package that allows you to do a lot of cools stuff with your new and improved home screen. Not only it supports the usually methods of unlocking like swipe or patterns, but you can actually set double or even triple tap options which is quite unique and a very good idea. The app has every other usual options including setting your favorite apps or showing the lock, as well as the date and the temperature of course.

## How to Remove a Previously Synced Google Account from Your Motorola Moto G Stylus 5G (2023)
