## Part 2: How to Unlock Samsung Galaxy S23+  Bootloader

Samsung Galaxy S23+  is the flagship device of HTC by all means. With a world of features and offerings, Samsung Galaxy S23+  truly is a beast. While the phone is very powerful without any modifications, the true potential is yet to be seen and that can only be done if the bootloader is unlocked. So, to have a complete control over the Samsung Galaxy S23+  device, it is important to unlock the bootloader and the process has to be carried out diligently. One of the initial things that needs to be ensured is that the Samsung Galaxy S23+  device is fully charged or atleast 80% mark. Make sure you have the fastboot drivers for the Samsung Galaxy S23+ device configured on the windows machine and the Android SDK. Here are some of the steps which can be followed to unlock bootloader.

Step 1: It is always very important to keep the phone data backed up and more so when you are planning to unlock the bootloader.

As one of the initial measures, backup the Samsung Galaxy S23+ device completely as bootloader unlocking process will wipe all the data off. So, backup all the data like photos, contacts, multimedia files, documents, etc.
