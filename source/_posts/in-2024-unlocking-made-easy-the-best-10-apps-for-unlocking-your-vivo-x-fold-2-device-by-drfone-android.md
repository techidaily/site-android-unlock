## 2.Lok Lok

Lok Lok has a unique take on the locking screen application niche, allowing you to send drawings to people who use the same application. It has the basic functions of course but it really is only fan when others you know, use the same app as well. This fact kind of restricts this otherwise excellent application but the idea is genius. An Android unlock screen app that allows your creative side to shine through.

This Android unlock app doesn't allow pin lock screen at the moment, it can be unlocked with the home button

A very interesting application with a slide-to-unlock feature that's eerily similar to iPhone devices. The app allows you to control several main phone functions including but not limited to brightness, WiFi, sound or Bluetooth. One of the most versatile unlock apps for Android.

This android unlock app allows pin and pattern unlock, and it also has an intruder alert (the phone locks and takes a photo when somebody unsuccessfully tries to unlock it).

## 7.Next Lock Screen

Next Lock Screen is a cross platform unlock app that's compatible with the complete Android ecosystem, making it one of the most valuable unlock apps for Android on the market. As a Microsoft product, it likes to advertise some of their other applications but this feature can thankfully be turned off. The notifications are clearly Microsoft quality which is not necessarily something that can be said about your average Android unlock screen app.

How to unlock : Pin,swipe or pattern.

The home screen will highlight notifications for which it will offer two options, either you swipe down in which case you will ignore the notification, or swipe anywhere else and the lock screen will unlock. What's really great about this Android unlock app is the fact that it can use your device's sensors, allowing it to detect its placement therefore whether or not it should be on or off.

## How to Remove a Previously Synced Google Account from Your Vivo X Fold 2

In this part, we will discuss the methods that can be used for removing the previously synced account from your Android phone without a phone reset.

### Method 1: Removing Google Account using the Android Settings Menu

The steps for this method are listed below.

- **Step 1:** On your Android phone go to the Settings option and choose Accounts & Backup.
- **Step 2:** Select the Manage Accounts option now and the list of the associated Google Devices will appear.
- **Step 3:** Choose and click on the Google Account that you want to remove and a pop-up message will appear to inform you that all the account data will be deleted with this action.

To confirm the removal of the account, click on the Remove account button.

### Method 2: Remove the Google account from the Android phone using the computer

There is another method using which you can remotely remove the Google account associated with your phone. The steps for the method are listed below.

- **Step 1:** Using another device or a PC, sign in to your Google account that was previously synced on this device and choose the Security option.
- **Step 2:** Next scroll down and then tap on the Your devices option and choose to Manage devices.
- **Step 3:** You will now see the list of devices linked to your Google account. Next, tap on Find a lost or stolen phone and then select the Remove option present next to Account access.
- **Step 4:** You will be again asked if you want to delete the account. Select the Remove option.
- **Step 5:** The account will be removed successfully and the confirmation message will appear.

**Note:** This method will actually sign out you from the Google account and will not delete it permanently. To again get access to the account, a notification will appear on your phone to enter the password.

## Part 2: How to Disable Factory Reset Protection to Bypass Google Account Verification After Factory Reset

The Factory Reset Protection (FRP) is a security feature for the Android device that allows factory reset only after the associated Google ID and password are entered correctly. With multiple accounts and passwords to remember there is quite a possibility that you may forget your Android phone Google account details and here the need to bypass Google account verification arises.

Though there are multiple tools available we recommend Dr. Fone - Screen Unlock (Android) as the best and the most reliable option. Using this excellent Windows and Mac-based software, FRP lock on all popular Android devices including Samsung, LG, HTC, and others. The tool is simple to use and requires no technology. There is also an option where you can unlock your device if you do not know the OS version.
