_Using the Android Device Manager to track a lost phone_

## Part 1: What is Android Device Manager lock?

Android Device Manager is Google’s take on Apple’s Find My iPhone. Enabling the ADM is quite easy; just go to google.com/android/devicemanager  on your computer and search through your list of devices that are already connected to your Google account. Once you are there, you can easily send a notification to the phone you want to enable remote password application and wiping upon.

ADM comes with a set of features that helps you to unlock your Android phone as well. It not only helps you to find your device, but also Ring it, lock it, and wipe and erase all the data as well, if your phone is lost or stolen. Once you’re logged into the ADM website from your computer, you can avail all these options once your phone is located. It is a wise option to get your device locked by Android Device Manager in case it is lost or stolen, so that your phone is secured.

Android Device Manager can unlock your phone under a specific set of circumstances only.

- • First of all, Android Device Manager needs to be enabled on your phone before it is lost, stolen, etc.
- • Secondly, your phone can only be tracked by ADM if the GPS option is switched on.
- • Thirdly, the Vivo Y78t device you are using for ADM, must be connected to Wi-Fi or internet, to login to your Google account.
- • Lastly, Android Device Manager is not compatible for all Android versions. For now, it is only compatible with devices running Android 4.4 and above, so your phone must be in this category for ADM to work.

## Part 2: How to unlock Android phone with Android Device Manager?

Just act according to the following steps, and the Android Device Manager will unlock your phone.

1\. On your computer or any other mobile phone, visit: google.com/android/devicemanager

2\. Then, sign in with the help of your Google login details that you had used in your locked phone as well.

3\. In the ADM interface, choose the Vivo Y78t device you want to unlock. Now, select “Lock”.

4\. Enter a temporary password. Now go ahead and click on “Lock” again.

5\. If the previous step was successful, you should be seeing a confirmation below the box with the buttons – Ring, Lock and Erase.

6\. Now, you should see a password field on your phone screen. Enter a temporary password to unlock your phone.

7\. Visit your phone’s lock screen settings and disable the temporary password.

The Android Device Manager has successfully unlocked your phone!

A downside to this process, is an error message faced by some users while using ADM. Many users have reported the issue, that when they have tried using ADM to unlock their locked device, an error message has occurred, saying, “since Google has verified that a screen lock is already set”. Basically, this error message conveys that you will not be able to unlock your phone using Android Device Manager, and this is a flaw on Google’s part, not your phone’s.

## Part 3: What to do if phone is locked by Android Device Manager

There are 2 situations where you would want to know how to unlock the Android Device Manager lock – one, when you have unfortunately forgotten the screen lock passcode and the other is when your phone is locked by Android Device Manager.

ADM is built to completely lock your device so that unknown people cannot access it. So, if your phone is locked by Android Device Manager, you might be in a problem.While ADM is a wonderful tool to lock your phone or erase and wipe data if its stolen or lost, most of the users have reported the issue that they cannot unlock their phones that are locked by Android Device Manager. A possible solution to this is adding a temporary password via Google login and bypassing the ADM lock. Or, you can try resetting the password again by entering a new password via ADM. If that does not work, you can make use of several third-party applications which can be found in the internet, that will help to completely erase the Android Device Manager lock.

So, now you know how to unlock the Android Device Manager lock. Do keep in mind, your device must be connected to internet or Wi-Fi, to login to your Google account.

### 1\. A Picture Possibly Bypasses Face Lock

You can use your photo to manipulate the face lock app. Simply use your photo to unlock the phone, which should work fine. If your phone doesn't recognize your face from a photo, try again.

If it still doesn't recognize your face, try a different photo or even change the camera's lighting settings or the angles to see if that helps.

Anyway, this method is still unstable because of many uncontrollable factors. If everything fails, consider the following methods to bypass the face lock.

### 2\. Hard Reset your phone

To get around the Android lock screen, perform a factory reset. While resetting your phone allows you to set a new password, it also erases all data from your device. This method works like a charm, but it also requires more technical knowledge. To bypass screen lock via factory reset, follow these steps.

![android hard reset](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/face-unlock-android-2.jpg)

**Step 1**: Turn off your phone and hold the Power and Volume-down buttons simultaneously until the recovery mode screen appears. There are minor variations depending on the brand and model.

**Step 2**: Select the Wipe data/Factory Reset option using the volume buttons. To confirm the option, press the Power button.

**Step 3**: Choose Yes > Delete All User Data, then press the power button to continue. When the process is complete, turn on your phone.

So, before facing such awkward cases, like data loss, we suggest you have a backup habit of keeping your data safe.

### 3\. Google Find My Device

Google Find My Device is a service that lets you remotely lock, track, and wipe data from stolen or lost phones. With a Google account and the password, it won't be complicated to remove any locks on your phone. You can bypass the Android lock screen by following the steps below:

![google find my device data reset](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/face-unlock-android-3.jpg)

**Step 1:** Navigate to Find My Device and sign in with your Google account.

**Step 2:** Your phone receives a notification.

**Step 3:** Select Erase Device, confirm, and click Erase as a warning pops up on the screen.

**Step 4:** The factory reset process on your phone begins. When it's finished, choose My Google Account instead of using your phone as if it were brand new.

Just like the hard reset, after using Google Find My Device, all your data and settings will be erased. Please make everything well prepared before you decide to unlock your device.
