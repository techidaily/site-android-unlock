## Unlocking the Power of Smart Lock: A Beginner's Guide for Vivo Y17s Users

Google constantly comes up with features to simplify the way users interact and complete tasks on the Android platform. One of the most important features that techies loved to debate about was the Smart Lock Android, a secure password manager functioning in sync with a Google account on the Android phone.

## Part 1: What is Android Smart Lock?

![smart lock android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14555162221345.jpg)

Android Lollipop added a feature called Smart Lock, and the feature was devised as a smart tool to prevent the Android phone from locking once it was initially unlocked. In other words, the feature overrides an Android phone's Lock Screen feature, thereby saving users the need to enter passwords every time the Vivo Y17s device locks.

If you're at home, it's likely your android phone is locked out if you haven't accessed at for some time. Smart Locks solves the problem in many ways. It allows you to allocate trusted places. Once you within range of the trusted places, your phone won't lock. Trusted devices come next. Smart Lock is assigned to Bluetooth and Android NFC unlock devices.

![smart lock android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14555165271526.jpg)

Finally, trusted face unlocking is the ultimate face recognition system that unlocks your Android device as soon as you look at it across the front-facing camera. A face unlock first introduced with Android Jelly Bean and has been significantly improved in later versions.

_Turning On Smart Lock_

The feature is enabled by first accessing settings. For example, in a Samsung Galaxy S6:

Within Smart Lock, there are three options for setting the system. You can set up trusted devices, trusted face, and trusted places individually, combining two or all three at the same time. You can choose just one trusted face, but you have the option to set up as many trusted devices and trusted places as needed.
