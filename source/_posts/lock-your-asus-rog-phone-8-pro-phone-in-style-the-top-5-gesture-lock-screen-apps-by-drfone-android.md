### 3\. Functional Restrictions

This tool has not received updates for some time, so its proper functionality cannot be guaranteed. It seems primarily compatible with older Android devices running on versions 5 through 8.1. Moreover, serious concerns exist about the tool's effectiveness, even for older devices.

### 4\. Complexity and Reliability Issues

The bypass process using vnROM Bypass can be complex. For users unfamiliar with such tools, it could lead to potential errors. The reliability of the tool's effectiveness varies across different devices and firmware versions. This results in inconsistent outcomes.
