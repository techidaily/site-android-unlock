Neither less to say, in order for the step to work properly, you need your Gmail account to be properly configured with the Lava Agni 2 5G device.

**Step 1: Attempt Passwords**

At first, you need to make five attempts to unlock your device. Whether you have used a PIN or Pattern lock, Android will always give you five attempts to get the password right. Once you get that, it will trigger the “Forget Password/Pattern” option on Your Lava Agni 2 5G. This way, you can sneak back into the system once again.

**Step 2: Enter Credentials**

Once you hit the option, you will be redirected to another page, where you need to enter your Gmail id and password. Make sure that you get the information right, and select “Sign in.”

![reset a motorola phone that is locked 7](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2020/12/reset-a-motorola-phone-that-is-locked-7.jpg)

Once you get everything right, this will bypass any password or pattern you once had put on your Phone. Just remember, you need to have a stable internet connection in order for the step to work seamlessly.
