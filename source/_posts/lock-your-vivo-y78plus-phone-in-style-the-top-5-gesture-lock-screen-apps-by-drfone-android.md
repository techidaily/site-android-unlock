## Method 3: Using your Samsung Account

This method is a reliable way to unlock a Samsung device that has a broken screen or is not working correctly. While it is highly effective you will need to have a Samsung account registered with your device. The problem is that not many Samsung device users have registered their devices with the service. If you are among the lucky few who have, here’s how to use your account to unlock your device.

**Step 1:** Visit the [https://findmymobile.samsung.com/login.do](https://findmymobile.samsung.com/login.do) on your PC or any other device and log in with your account information.

**Step 2:** Select your device from the menu on the left-hand side of the screen.

**Step 3:** You should see the option “Unlock my screen” on the sidebar. Click on it and you will get instructions on how to access your device.

## Conclusion

Being unable to unlock your device is never a good place to be. We hope one of the above solutions will work for you. You can then gain access to your device and back up the files and contacts. This way your life doesn’t have to be disrupted- you can just restore the backup on a new device or the old one once the screen is fixed.
