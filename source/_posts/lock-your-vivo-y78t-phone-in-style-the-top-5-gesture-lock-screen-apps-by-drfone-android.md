## Rootjunky APK To Bypass Google FRP Lock For Vivo Y78t 

Factory Reset Protection (FRP) is a security feature built into Android devices running Android 5.1 Lollipop and later versions. It prevents someone from using your phone after a factory data reset without Google account login credentials.

FRP automatically activates when you add a Google account to your Android phone. It links the Vivo Y78t device to your account, making it the “trusted owner.” Once activated, FRP becomes embedded in the phone’s system.

While Google FRP is a valuable security feature, it’s vital to acknowledge that there are legitimate situations where bypassing it might be necessary.
