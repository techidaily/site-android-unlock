What are the top 2 common problems?

Below are the two most common problems faced by Android users during their efforts to disable the feature of screen lock.

**1\. In the Screen Security choice, the None bar can not be chosen.**

Description of the problem: There is a sentence below it stated: "Disabled by administrators, encryption policy or credential storage". All the space of the None option is in white and grey.

Step 1: Open the Settings menu from the main screen. Then tap on the Credential Storage. You will see a drop-down menu like the screenshot below.

Before we move towards the **Sony Xperia 5 V  pattern unlock**, let's talk about its lock types and security system.

### 1: Google Find My Device

You can use the Google Find My Device for your **Sony Xperia 5 V  pattern unlock**. It is a simple privacy and security Google feature that enables users to reset their android phones. Most people use it to factory reset their phones when someone steals their phones. Although Google Find My Device works every time, it is not the ideal solution if you don't want to lose your data. With a hard reset, you lose all your data and settings. It is not worth it if all you want to do is unlock your screen. Here are the steps to unlock Sony Xperia 5 V  with Find My Device.

![google find my device web home page](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/oppo-a37-password-unlock-01.jpg)

### 3: Answer Security Questions

If you want to unlock your Sony  phone, you can also answer some security questions and reset the password. This method does not work on all Sony  devices, but you can use it for **Sony Xperia 5 V  screen unlock without PC**. You will see various questions if your Google account is linked with the Sony Xperia 5 V device. All questions are based on your profile and credentials. You have to answer precisely with proper spaces. Here are the steps to unlock Sony Xperia 5 V  with security questions.

![Sony Xperia 5 V  forgot pattern interface](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/oppo-a37-password-unlock-03.jpg)

### 4: Hard Reset (data loss)

A hard reset would be the best solution if you forgot your phone's lock screen password or pattern. However, you can unlock your phone with your Google account as well. Do a hard reset if you can't remember your Google account password and don't want to use third-party tools. The only problem with hard resetting is that you lose all your data, images, files, settings, and personalization. That is why you can't recover any of your data after the hard reset if you don't have a data backup. The process of hard reset is different for every device. Here are the steps for **Sony Xperia 5 V  pattern unlock without a PC** through a hard reset.

- Switch off your Sony Xperia 5 V  with the power button.
