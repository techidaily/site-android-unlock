The process to disable the screen lock on Android may seem easy to handle as well as straightforward to several customers, but there are still some annoying problems that users have to deal with while trying to disable the lock screen.

What are the top 2 common problems?

Below are the two most common problems faced by Android users during their efforts to disable the feature of screen lock.

**1\. In the Screen Security choice, the None bar can not be chosen.**

Description of the problem: There is a sentence below it stated: "Disabled by administrators, encryption policy or credential storage". All the space of the None option is in white and grey.

The solution to this problem is quite simple. Once you have made sure you are suffering from this nasty one, try to follow these below pieces of advice to see if it is capable of giving you a hand.

Step 1: Open the Settings menu from the main screen. Then tap on the Credential Storage. You will see a drop-down menu like the screenshot below.

Step 2: Continue to tap on the Clear Credentials (Remove all certificates) option. Then next click on the OK button. Wait for some seconds until your Android device has finished the process.

Step 3: To make sure that the previous step has been performed successfully, try looking at the bottom of the drop-down menu. If the Clear Credentials (Remove all certificates) are grey out and can not be selected, then you have managed to do it.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![disable lock screen android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14556833184389.jpg)

Step 4: Now that the problem is solved, you can feel free to turn back to your Screen lock option in the beginning and disable the feature of locking screen Android as usual.

2\. You have mistakenly encrypted your SD card. You want to disable the encryption, only to realize that it requires you to set a new screen lock code. But when you come to the Screen lock menu, all the options but Password have been greyed out.

![disable lock screen android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14555323367933.jpg)![disable lock screen android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14555323405268.jpg)

This is pretty weird, but actually, it is one of the most common troubles that many users have complained about. But to your surprise, the solution is very simple and easy. All you have to do is to reset your password, but with a little change. Your password MUST include at least ONE NUMBER in it. Confirm your new password then you will be able to disable the lock screen Android as usual.

## Part 1: How to set up Pattern Lock Screen on Vivo V29?

Out of all the provided options for screen locks, pattern lock is mostly used due to its ease of access and added security. If you haven’t set up a screen lock pattern on your device, then we recommend you to do the same right away. Not only will it keep intruders away, it will also protect your privacy. To learn how to set up a lock screen pattern on an Android device, simply follow these steps:

- 1\. Firstly, unlock your device and go to its Settings. You can access it from the Home Screen or from its Notification Center.
- 2\. Under the personal or privacy section, you can access the “Lock Screen and Security” option.
- 3\. In some versions, the option is also listed right at the top of the settings (in its quick access).

- 4\. To set up a pattern lock screen, tap on the “Screen lock type” feature.
- 5\. This will provide a list of all the different kinds of locks that you can apply. Ideally, it would be password, pin, pattern, swipe, or none. In “Swipe”, you can unlock a device just by swiping the screen. Whereas, in pattern, pin, or password, you would be needed to provide the respective pattern/pin/password to unlock the Vivo V29 device.
- 6\. We recommend setting up a lock screen pattern instead. To do this, tap on the “Pattern” option.

- 8\. Furthermore, you need to confirm your choice and provide the same pattern once again. Make sure that you draw the same pattern here.
- 9\. Additionally, the interface will ask you to provide a security pin as well. In case if you will forget your pattern, then you can access your phone by taking the assistance of this pin.

![setup android pattern lock screen](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/09/15057380143598.jpg) ![setup android pattern lock screen-provide the same pattern](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/09/15057380317550.jpg) ![setup android pattern lock screen-provide a security pin](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/09/15057380506350.jpg)
