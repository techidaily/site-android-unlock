## Method 3: Factory Reset Asus ROG Phone 7  Phones (Wipes User Data)

There is a standard factory reset built into every Asus ROG Phone 7  phone to allow users to erase the Asus ROG Phone 7 device and start over fully. This option wipes all user data and resets the phone to how you received it in the box.

Overall, this method consumes a lot of time.

**Step 1:** Go to Settings > Backup & Reset.

**Step 2:** Tap Factory Reset > Reset Phone.

**Step 3:** Tap Erase Everything.
