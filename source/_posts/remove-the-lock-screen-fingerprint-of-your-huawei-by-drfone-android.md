The process to disable the screen lock on Android may seem easy to handle as well as straightforward to several customers, but there are still some annoying problems that users have to deal with while trying to disable the lock screen.

You can only set up a screen lock as a password, pattern, and PIN. You can also lock apps on Huawei Nova Y71  with its privacy password settings.

Here are the steps for **Huawei Nova Y71  pattern unlock without a PC** through a hard reset.
