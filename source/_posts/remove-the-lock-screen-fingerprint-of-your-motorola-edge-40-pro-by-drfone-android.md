## Part 1: What Does It Mean When Your Motorola Edge 40 Pro Phone is Network Locked?

In the simplest words, a network-locked Motorola Edge 40 Pro phone means that your device has become carrier-specific.

Having a network-locked Motorola Edge 40 Pro phone poses undesired connectivity issues.

### 1\. Why is my phone locked to the network carrier?

Smartphones are network locked by carrier services to prevent customers from switching to a different carrier. Reasons for switching can be the availability of better plans, discounts, etc. Another cause of locking the phones to specific carriers is preventing them from theft and unauthorized usage.

### 2\. Is it legal to unlock it?

Unlocking your network-locked phone is legal in every sense. It is however advisable to contact your service provider for addressing the concern. The only downside of unlocking such phones is the loss of device warranty assured at the time of purchase.
