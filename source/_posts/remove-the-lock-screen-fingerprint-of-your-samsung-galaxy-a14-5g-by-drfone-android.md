## Part 1. Why you need to Lock Apps on Android?

Before we get down to the business of locking some of your Apps, let’s look at some of the reasons why you would want to lock certain apps.

- If you have children, you can eliminate the many accidental in-app purchases by locking the apps your children shouldn’t be on.
