## Part 1: What Is the Knox Enrollment Service?

### Rooting and Flashing a New ROM To Remove Knox Enrollment Service

For the more tech-savvy users, another method to **bypass Knox Enrollment Service** is by rooting the Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra device and flashing a new ROM. This process involves gaining root access to the Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra device’s operating system, which allows you to modify the software extensively.
