## Rootjunky APK To Bypass Google FRP Lock For Samsung Galaxy A15 4G 

Factory Reset Protection (FRP) is a security feature built into Android devices running Android 5.1 Lollipop and later versions.

FRP automatically activates when you add a Google account to your Android phone. It links the Samsung Galaxy A15 4G device to your account, making it the “trusted owner.” Once activated, FRP becomes embedded in the phone’s system.
