## Rootjunky APK To Bypass Google FRP Lock For Vivo S17t 

Factory Reset Protection (FRP) is a security feature built into Android devices running Android 5.1 Lollipop and later versions. It prevents someone from using your phone after a factory data reset without Google account login credentials. The FRP makes it much less attractive for thieves to steal Android phones, knowing they will need help to access them.

FRP automatically activates when you add a Google account to your Android phone. It links the Vivo S17t device to your account, making it the “trusted owner.” Once activated, FRP becomes embedded in the phone’s system.

While Google FRP is a valuable security feature, it’s vital to acknowledge that there are legitimate situations where bypassing it might be necessary. These instances include forgotten Google account credentials, buying a second-hand device, and device issues. In these cases, tools like **RootJunky** can help you [<u>bypass FRP Lock</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/google-frp-unlock/bypass-frp-with-computer.html). We’ll explore how to use **RootJunky APK** later, but first, let’s define what it is and its role in FRP bypass.

The **RootJunky APK** is a free Android application also called RootJunky SDL or **RootJunky FRP** Bypass tool.

## Part 3: Unlock Android password using custom recovery and Pattern Password Disable (SD card needed)?

The third way to unlock an Android phone password without a factory reset it using the “custom recovery” technique. To work out this process, you would have to install the custom recovery process. Also, your phone needs to have an SD card. It will be required to send the zip file to the phone since your device is locked. This technique requires access to the Android System folder and rooting your device if not already rooted.

Custom recovery is a usual mechanism in all smartphones. It predicts the troubleshooting techniques and how to process the main configuration with all sequences. Quite interesting, isn’t it?

Follow the following steps to complete and unlock the Android password without a factory reset.

- **Step 1.** First of all, download a zip file by the name [“Pattern Password Disable”](https://forum.xda-developers.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=2532214&d=1390399283) to the computer system and then transfer it to your SD card.
- **Step 2.** Then you would need to insert the SD card into your locked phone and then restart the Vivo S17t device in recovery mode.
- **Step 3.** Next, move on to flash on the zip files to the card and restart. After that, your phone will boot and open up without the locked screen.

_**Note**: Sometimes, the Vivo S17t device may ask for a pattern or password. You just need to put in any random pattern/password then it will get unlocked._

Through this easy method, you can now access your Android phone without using a factory reset and losing your valuable data.
