## Method 3: Factory Reset Samsung Galaxy F34 5G  Phones (Wipes User Data)

This option wipes all user data and resets the phone to how you received it in the box.

Overall, this method consumes a lot of time.

**Step 1:** Go to Settings > Backup & Reset.

**Step 2:** Tap Factory Reset > Reset Phone.

**Step 3:** Tap Erase Everything.

## Method 4: Use Google Find My Device To Unlock Samsung Galaxy F34 5G  Phones (Wipes User Data)

Using Find My Device, you can play a sound on the Samsung Galaxy F34 5G device to locate it in the house if you have misplaced it, lock the phone in case it is lost, and wipe the Samsung Galaxy F34 5G device remotely.

**Step 1:** Go to <https://accounts.google.com>.
