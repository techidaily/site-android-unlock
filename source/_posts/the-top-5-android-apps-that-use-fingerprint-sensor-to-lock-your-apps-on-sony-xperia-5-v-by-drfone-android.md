### 6\. Clean Your Finger

#### Problem

The problem may lie with your fingers rather than the Sony Xperia 5 V device. Unclean or moist fingers can hinder accurate fingerprint recognition on the sensor, causing **the Sony Xperia 5 V fingerprint sensor to not work**.

#### Solution

##### 1\. Cleanse and Dry Your Hands

Remove any dirt, oil, or moisture that might cause issues with the fingerprint sensor. It's crucial to wash and thoroughly dry your hands.
