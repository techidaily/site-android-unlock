## 6.Semper

This Android unlock app was once called UnlockYourBrain and it is quite unique in the way that it will make you work for your phone time. This may sound ridiculous at first, but actually a very clever idea and naturally emergency numbers can be called at all times.

Google Play link: [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=co.unlockyourbrain&hl=en](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=co.unlockyourbrain&hl=en)

How to unlock : Solve a problem or an equation to unlock the screen.

## 7.Next Lock Screen

Next Lock Screen is a cross platform unlock app that's compatible with the complete Android ecosystem, making it one of the most valuable unlock apps for Android on the market. As a Microsoft product, it likes to advertise some of their other applications but this feature can thankfully be turned off. The notifications are clearly Microsoft quality which is not necessarily something that can be said about your average Android unlock screen app.

How to unlock : Pin,swipe or pattern.

## 8.AcDisplay

AcDisplay comes with a rather minimalistic look similar to some of the most popular web site creator services like Squarespace or Wix. The home screen will highlight notifications for which it will offer two options, either you swipe down in which case you will ignore the notification, or swipe anywhere else and the lock screen will unlock. What's really great about this Android unlock app is the fact that it can use your device's sensors, allowing it to detect its placement therefore whether or not it should be on or off.

Google Play link: [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.achep.acdisplay&hl=en](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.achep.acdisplay&hl=en)

How to unlock : You can swipe anywhere on the screen.

## 9.C Locker Pro

It would be unjust to call it an Android unlock app, this application is actually a carefully selected package that allows you to do a lot of cools stuff with your new and improved home screen. Not only it supports the usually methods of unlocking like swipe or patterns, but you can actually set double or even triple tap options which is quite unique and a very good idea. The app has every other usual options including setting your favorite apps or showing the lock, as well as the date and the temperature of course.

Google Play link: [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ccs.lockscreen\_pro&hl=en](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ccs.lockscreen_pro&hl=en)
