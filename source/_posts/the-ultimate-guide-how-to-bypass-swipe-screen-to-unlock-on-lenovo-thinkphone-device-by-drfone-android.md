**Password:** Your phone's highest level of security. Your password must be distinct, easily remembered, and include at least one letter and 7 characters.

Follow the setup instructions on-screen after selecting the security measure you prefer.

Additionally, you'll notice options to enable fingerprint or face biometric recognition features. Iris Scanner (S8/S8+) or Intelligent Scan (S9/S9+) may also be available on some older Samsung® models.

**Face recognition:** By holding your face directly in front of your phone's screen, you may unlock your phone and authenticate yourself in apps.

With fingerprints, you can quickly touch your finger to unlock your phone.

**Iris:** Check your eyes to make sure that only you can see the contents of your phone.

**Intelligent Scan:** A method of device unlocking that combines face and iris recognition technology.

Follow on-screen instructions if you decide to employ one of these sophisticated security technologies, or go to Settings > Biometrics and security for more customization choices.

## How to look up saved passwords on my device?

The way that Google Chrome manages your usernames and passwords is excellent. But what if you want to log in to a particular website from another device but can't recall your password, and the website won't load the data for you? You may quickly obtain a list of all saved passwords by browsing through Chrome's settings, then manually keying it in.

You may access the passwords saved in the Google Chrome app on a Mac or PC because the app is connected to your Google account. Any passwords saved on your Android phone can easily be removed via the Chrome app.

In case you lose your pattern, PIN, or other passwords, older versions of Android, including Android 4.4 KitKat, have an integrated feature to let you continue using your device.

Enter an erroneous pattern or PIN five times on the lock screen to reveal this function. A button with the words "Forgot pattern," "Forgot PIN," or "Forgot password" will show up. Tap it. The username and password for the Google account connected to your Android smartphone will be required.

### 4\. Using ADB

Launch Recovery mode and restart the phone. Turn off your phone. Then to access the Bootloader, simultaneously press the Power button and the Volume Down key. Then select Recovery mode.

Use USB to connect the phone. You must have ADB set up on your computer. (ADB is part of the Android Developer Bundle)

Use the shell's following command to start

Rm /data/system/gesture.key using the adb shell

Turn the phone back on normally. Any pattern will unlock the screen, and you will be prompted to enter one.
