## How To Change Samsung Galaxy F04 Lock Screen Password?

## Part 3: Hire a Remote FRP Removal Service to Bypass ZTE/Motorola After Factory Reset

To bypass the FRP lock on your ZTE, Motorola, and Samsung device, there is also an online service called UnlockJunky.com that claims to remove the FRP lock and previously linked account on your Android device within 5-15 minutes. This is a paid service that also claims that if they are unable to remove the lock, they will refund the amount to their customers.

So, if you cannot sign in **with a Google account that was previously synced**, you can give this, method a try.

**Step 1:** Open the official service page [Unlockjunky](https://unlockjunky.com/) on your browser.

**Step 2:** Next, choose the Samsung Galaxy F04 device's brand, model, and unlock type from their respective drop-down menus. Click on Unlock Now button after entering the details.

**Step 3:** Now you need to initiate the order by providing the details asked and completing the payment.

**Step 4:** Next, the software needs to be downloaded and installed on your system, and using a USB cable, connect your phone to your computer.

**Step 5:** Connect with one of the support provider members through the live chat and they will help you remove the FRP lock on your Android phone.

With the steps above, you can remove the account **previously synced on this device**.

**Limitations of using the Unlockjunky method**:

- This is a paid service.
- Works only with Motorola, ZTE, and Samsung devices.
- There is no surety that the service will work for removing the FRP lock on your devices.
- If you have to remove the FRP lock from multiple devices, a separate payment for each device has to be done.
