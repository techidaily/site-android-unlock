## Pro Tips: Unlock Your Android Phones When You Forgot the Fingerprint

Setting a fingerprint lock or PIN, password, pattern, or even FRP lock on an Android phone is a common way to prevent our important data or private info from being prying eyes. However, if you forgot the fingerprint, or get your Android phone broken with a screen cracked, and enter the wrong password several times, you will be stuck on the problem and won’t be able to access your phone and all the apps on the Samsung Galaxy F34 5G device. Don't be too worried. Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (Android) provides you with an Android phone unlocking feature to unlock any phone fingerprint and any screen locks, including numeric password, pattern, 4-digit/6-digit/custom PIN, fingerprint ID, face recognition, etc.
