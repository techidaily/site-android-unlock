## Part 1: How to set up Pattern Lock Screen on Lava Blaze 2 5G?

Out of all the provided options for screen locks, pattern lock is mostly used due to its ease of access and added security. If you haven’t set up a screen lock pattern on your device, then we recommend you to do the same right away. Not only will it keep intruders away, it will also protect your privacy. To learn how to set up a lock screen pattern on an Android device, simply follow these steps:

- 1\. Firstly, unlock your device and go to its Settings. You can access it from the Home Screen or from its Notification Center.
- 2\. Under the personal or privacy section, you can access the “Lock Screen and Security” option.
- 3\. In some versions, the option is also listed right at the top of the settings (in its quick access).

- 4\. To set up a pattern lock screen, tap on the “Screen lock type” feature.
- 5\. This will provide a list of all the different kinds of locks that you can apply. Ideally, it would be password, pin, pattern, swipe, or none. In “Swipe”, you can unlock a device just by swiping the screen. Whereas, in pattern, pin, or password, you would be needed to provide the respective pattern/pin/password to unlock the Lava Blaze 2 5G device.
- 6\. We recommend setting up a lock screen pattern instead. To do this, tap on the “Pattern” option.

## Part 6: How to bypass forgot pattern lock using Factory Reset

Bypassing a forgotten pattern lock on an Android device using a factory reset is a last resort. The reason is it will erase all data on your device, including apps, photos, and settings. However, it can be an effective way to regain access to your device when other methods have failed. Here's how to do it:

**Step 1:** Turn off your Samsung device and connect it to your computer. Now press and hold “Volume Up” and “Power” keys for a while. Release the keys once the Lava Blaze 2 5G device enters Recovery Mode.

**Step 2:** In Recovery Mode, use the Volume keys to navigate to “Wipe data/factory reset” and select it with the “Power” key. Confirm the action on the next screen by selecting “Factory data reset.”
