## Tips and Tricks for Setting Up your Lava Blaze Pro 5G Phone Pattern Lock

Failing to remember the **pattern lock** of a phone is one of the most puzzling situations for Android users. Unlike the famous OS, Android gives a seamless method to eliminate the issue.

You can attempt the methods below or an expert tool if you have forgotten the **pattern lock** on your gadget and reset it. However, we suggest you try Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock for a quick and safe solution. To make things more straightforward, we have given you other techniques as a workaround to the issue.

So, keep following us to unlock the **lock screen pattern** and use your phone again.

## Part 1: What Is Android Pattern?

A **pattern lock** is used to identify the actual user by your Android phone. It is a widely used phone locking system and a secured one. Simply put, a pattern lock includes a line pattern you choose that you can draw to unlock a lock screen. You can enable this lock screen feature from the security menu in the settings application.

So, if you have set a **pattern lock** as a screen lock for your device, you will need to draw the exact pattern every time you log in.

## Part 1: Lock System About Lava Blaze Pro 5G  

### 1: Lock Types

Before we move towards the **Lava Blaze Pro 5G  pattern unlock**, let's talk about its lock types and security system. Lava Blaze Pro 5G  is one of the older versions of Lava  android phones that was released in 2016. At that time, only flagship phones from each brand came with features like fingerprint sensors and facial unlock. Lava Blaze Pro 5G  doesn't offer these lock types. You can only set up a screen lock as a password, pattern, and PIN. You can also lock apps on Lava Blaze Pro 5G  with its privacy password settings.

### 1: Google Find My Device

You can use the Google Find My Device for your **Lava Blaze Pro 5G  pattern unlock**. It is a simple privacy and security Google feature that enables users to reset their android phones. Most people use it to factory reset their phones when someone steals their phones. Although Google Find My Device works every time, it is not the ideal solution if you don't want to lose your data. With a hard reset, you lose all your data and settings. It is not worth it if all you want to do is unlock your screen. Here are the steps to unlock Lava Blaze Pro 5G  with Find My Device.

### 4: Hard Reset (data loss)

A hard reset would be the best solution if you forgot your phone's lock screen password or pattern. However, you can unlock your phone with your Google account as well. Do a hard reset if you can't remember your Google account password and don't want to use third-party tools. The only problem with hard resetting is that you lose all your data, images, files, settings, and personalization. That is why you can't recover any of your data after the hard reset if you don't have a data backup. The process of hard reset is different for every device. Here are the steps for **Lava Blaze Pro 5G  pattern unlock without a PC** through a hard reset.

- Switch off your Lava Blaze Pro 5G  with the power button.

![power key](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/oppo-a37-password-unlock-04.jpg)

- Press and hold the Volume down + Power buttons together for a few seconds. Hold the keys until you see the Lava  logo on the screen.
