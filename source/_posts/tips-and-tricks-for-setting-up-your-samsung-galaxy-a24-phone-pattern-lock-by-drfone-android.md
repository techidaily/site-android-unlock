## Tips and Tricks for Setting Up your Samsung Galaxy A24 Phone Pattern Lock

Failing to remember the **pattern lock** of a phone is one of the most puzzling situations for Android users. Unlike the famous OS, Android gives a seamless method to eliminate the issue.

You can attempt the methods below or an expert tool if you have forgotten the **pattern lock** on your gadget and reset it. However, we suggest you try Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock for a quick and safe solution. To make things more straightforward, we have given you other techniques as a workaround to the issue.

So, keep following us to unlock the **lock screen pattern** and use your phone again.

## Part 1: What Is Android Pattern?

A **pattern lock** is used to identify the actual user by your Android phone. It is a widely used phone locking system and a secured one. Simply put, a pattern lock includes a line pattern you choose that you can draw to unlock a lock screen. You can enable this lock screen feature from the security menu in the settings application.

So, if you have set a **pattern lock** as a screen lock for your device, you will need to draw the exact pattern every time you log in.

## Part 2: Best Tool to Unlock Your Pattern

### Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock

The most effective and quick tool to unlock a **pattern lock** is Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock by Wondershare. Dr.Fone is an all-in-one tool for all your Android needs and has been in the business for a long time. We suggest you use Dr.Fone. The following steps will help you unlock your device:

**Step 1.** Select the "Screen Unlock" option in the Dr.Fone interface.

**Step 2. Select Unlock Android Screen**

To unlock the pattern lock on your device, the “Unlock Android Screen” will guide you to finish the whole process.

**Step 3. Select unlock mode**
