### 1: Lock Types

Before we move towards the **Vivo Y100i  pattern unlock**, let's talk about its lock types and security system. Vivo Y100i  is one of the older versions of Vivo  android phones that was released in 2016.

Follow these steps to set up any type of lock on your Vivo Y100i  .

- Open “Settings” on your mobile and select "Lockscreen and Password".

- Select the "Lockscreen Password" option at the top and tap on the "Enable Lock Screen" button.
- Select the type of lock you want to set and create a password.

### 3: How to Remove Them with Password or Pattern?

### 1: Google Find My Device

Most people use it to factory reset their phones when someone steals their phones. Although Google Find My Device works every time, it is not the ideal solution if you don't want to lose your data.

### 4: Hard Reset (data loss)

That is why you can't recover any of your data after the hard reset if you don't have a data backup. The process of hard reset is different for every device. Here are the steps for **Vivo Y100i  pattern unlock without a PC** through a hard reset.

- Switch off your Vivo Y100i  with the power button.
