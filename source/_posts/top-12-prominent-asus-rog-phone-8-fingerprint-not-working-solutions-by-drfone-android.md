<!-- affiliate ads end -->

### 1\. Limited Compatibility

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

### 2\. Security Risks

Using bypass tools like vnROM Bypass can potentially expose devices to security risks. One significant factor contributing to this situation is the absence of an official website for the tool. Furthermore, it has not received updates for quite a while. This makes it a potential security risk for newer Android models.
