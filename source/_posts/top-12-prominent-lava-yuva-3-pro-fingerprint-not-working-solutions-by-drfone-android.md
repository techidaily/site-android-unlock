Some methods might work without erasing your data, while others, like factory resetting, may erase all content from your phone.

## 1\. How to Unlock Lava Yuva 3 Pro  With Google Find My Lava Yuva 3 Pro?

A way to unlock the Lava Yuva 3 Pro  phone is via Google Find My Device feature. While this method can help unlock your phone, it erases all content from it.

**Step 1:** Open your browser and go to [Google Find My Device](https://www.google.com/android/find) on your PC.

![google account verification](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/05/google-account-verification.jpg)

**Step 2:** Log in to the Google account you used to set up your Lava Yuva 3 Pro  phone.

Selecting this option will erase all content from your device, including screen unlock PIN, password, and pattern.
