#### Solution

##### 1\. Cleaning the Phone

Setting a fingerprint lock or PIN, password, pattern, or even FRP lock on an Android phone is a common way to prevent our important data or private info from being prying eyes. However, if you forgot the fingerprint, or get your Android phone broken with a screen cracked, and enter the wrong password several times, you will be stuck on the problem and won’t be able to access your phone and all the apps on the Oppo A18 device.
