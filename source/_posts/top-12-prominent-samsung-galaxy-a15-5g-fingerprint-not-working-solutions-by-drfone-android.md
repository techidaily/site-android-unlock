If you have added a trusted area or device in Google Smart Lock, you can go to that trusted area and reset your password. Alternatively, you can also use trusted devices to unlock your device.

### 2\. Google Find My Device

1. Login using your Google credentials by going to the official Google Find My Device website.
2. You will see the gadgets connected to your Google account as you enter the interface and a map of where they are.

### 3\. Recovery Mode

Users of Android smartphones and tablets can troubleshoot various issues with their devices using a feature known as Android Recovery Mode. If you discover that your device is functioning strangely, it might be helpful.
