#### Solution

##### 1\. Cleaning the Phone

Employ a gentle, dry microfiber cloth for wiping down the complete surface of your Pixel device. Take particular care to thoroughly clean the region surrounding the fingerprint sensor.

![dirty sensor or phone issue](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/pixel-7-fingerprint-not-working-8.jpg)

### 5\. Screen Protector: Dirty or Damaged

#### Problem

A smudged or impaired screen protector might disrupt the working of the fingerprint sensor. This can potentially cause it to fail to recognize your fingerprint.

#### Solution

##### 1\. Clean the Screen Protector

Start by effectively cleaning the screen protector on your Pixel device. For a thorough cleaning, consider utilizing a screen cleaning solution. Ensure that the screen protector is free from any dirt or debris.

##### 2\. Replace Damaged Protectors

Is the screen protector visibly damaged, scratched, or peeling off? If yes, consider replacing it with a new one. Damaged protectors can hinder fingerprint recognition and compromise device protection.

#### Solution

##### 1\. Cleanse and Dry Your Hands

#### Problem

Fingerprint marks or smudges on the screen might disrupt sensor functionality. This leads to inaccurate recognition when you try to unlock your device.

#### Solution

##### 1\. Avoid Covering the Sensor Area

Be cautious while cleaning the screen to avoid covering or smudging the area around the fingerprint sensor. Precise cleaning around this area prevents interference with sensor functionality.

##### 2\. Use Proper Holding Technique

While holding the Samsung Galaxy F54 5G device, avoid placing your fingers or palms over the fingerprint sensor. Opt for holding the Samsung Galaxy F54 5G device to minimize accidental contact with the sensor area.
