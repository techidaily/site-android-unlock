### Conclusion

Passwords shield our phones from unapproved access, yet we get locked out unexpectedly on our **phone lock**. Failing to remember your PIN can be irritating. However, we can assist you in reaccessing your locked phone without a factory reset by using Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock. Dr.Fone is an expert in solving such problems in just a few minutes. So download this expert tool immediately for a quick solution.



## How to Bypass Android Lock Screen Using Emergency Call On Lava Blaze 2 5G?

The main reason why we keep our smartphone locked is to prevent children (or stalkers) checking out our private photos or messages. You don't want anyone to access your pictures, emails, or other important data. What if you forget your pattern or PIN and cannot access your phone? Or someone changes lock screen pattern to leave you annoyed?

To avoid such types of conditions, we have tried and tested the following methods to bypass the Lava lock screen pattern, PIN, password, and fingerprint.

- Step 4. Click the "Lock" button at the bottom
- Step 5. Within a few minutes, it will change the lock screen password to the PIN so that you can unlock your device.
