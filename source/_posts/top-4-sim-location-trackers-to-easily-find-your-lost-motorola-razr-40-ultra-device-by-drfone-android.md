FRP, popularly known as the Factory Reset Protection program, is an additional data protection feature for all Android users. As per the FRP feature, in any unfortunate event wherein you lose the Motorola Razr 40 Ultra device or if any unauthorized person tries to reset it, the Motorola Razr 40 Ultra device will require the Google Account ID and password to be fed in. So, this program is designed to curb the chances of theft and other fraudulent activities.

However, it was found that the FRP feature comes out as trouble for those who somehow forget their Google Account ID/ password, or who have purchased a second-hand phone either online or via some third-party source. Hence, it is important to know how to bypass a Google Account. Below mentioned are the Top 10 FRP tools to bypass Google accounts.
