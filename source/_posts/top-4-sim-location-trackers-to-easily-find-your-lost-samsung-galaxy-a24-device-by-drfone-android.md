## How to Unlock Samsung Galaxy A24  with Google Account?

Almost all Android smartphones, including Samsung Galaxy A24 , require you to enter your Google account details when setting up your phone for the first time.

### Using Google Account Details

Almost all Android smartphones, including Samsung Galaxy A24 , require you to enter your Google account details when setting up your phone for the first time. This account comes in handy later on in situations where your phone is lost or stolen or if you’re switching to another phone. However, it can also help with basic issues like unlocking your phone in case you forget your Samsung Galaxy A24  screen unlock PIN, pattern, or password. But to use this method successfully, you need to remember the email address bound to the Samsung Galaxy A24 device and its password.

- **Step 1:** Enter the incorrect PIN, pattern, or password 5 times, and click on “Forgot Password” or “Forgot Pattern.”

### Using Security Question

## How to Unlock Samsung Galaxy A24  by Hard Reset?

Hard resetting your smartphone usually solves everything! Hence, it can also help you unlock your Samsung Galaxy A24  phone; however, using this method will erase all the data on your phone. So, if you still want to unlock Samsung Galaxy A24  phone using this method, only do so if you have backed up your device and have no other way to unlock your phone. This includes forgetting your Google account details or not having access to a PC to download and use Dr Fone - Screen Unlock (Android).

## How to Remove Operator Lock on Samsung Galaxy A24 ?

An operator lock, also called a carrier lock, constitutes a limitation imposed on a mobile phone by a network provider. This measure is implemented to guarantee that the Samsung Galaxy A24 device exclusively functions with the services provided by that specific carrier. If you wish to remove the operator lock from your Samsung Galaxy A24  device, you'll need to follow specific steps and meet certain criteria. Here's how to remove the operator lock on a Samsung Galaxy A24 :

**Step 1:** Begin by checking whether your device can be unlocked or not from its network carrier restrictions. To do that, you need to dial the code “\*#\*#7378423#\*#\*” on your device, tap “Service Info” and select “SIM Lock.”

![dial the provided number](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/10/unlock-sony-xperia-pin-code-5.jpg)

**Step 2:** Carefully check the information provided on the screen. If there is "X" before the "Network" option and the number in front of it is larger than 0, it means your device can be unlocked. If the number in front of "Network" is 0, your device can't be unlocked as it is hard-locked.
