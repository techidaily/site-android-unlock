## Part 1: An Introduction to IMEI Numbers and Its Utility

Every mobile device has a special identifier that is helpful in the **anti-theft app & IMEI tracker** activities. It is known as the International Mobile Equipment Identity or IMEI number. While often overlooked, it holds the key to many essential services and functions.

This makes it an indispensable component of modern mobile technology. The IMEI number serves as a digital fingerprint for mobile phones. Its primary purposes are summarized below:

1. **Device Identification:** Each mobile device possesses a distinct IMEI number. This sets it apart from every other phone in existence. This identification is essential for cellular networks and service providers. It helps in recognizing, managing, and connecting devices accurately.
2. **Traceability and Tracking:** In cases of theft, loss, or unauthorized use, the IMEI number becomes a crucial tool for tracking. It provides law enforcement agencies with the means to pinpoint the Vivo V27e device's location.
3. **Warranty and Support:** Manufacturers use IMEI numbers to manage warranties and provide technical support. These numbers help confirm the Vivo V27e device's authenticity, purchase date, and warranty coverage. This streamlines the process of repairs and replacements.
4. **Security Measures:** IMEI numbers play a role in security measures such as device blacklisting. If a device is reported stolen, its IMEI number can be added to a global database. This prevents it from being used on any network and renders it useless to thieves.

## Part 3: Hire a Remote FRP Removal Service to Bypass ZTE/Motorola After Factory Reset

To bypass the FRP lock on your ZTE, Motorola, and Samsung device, there is also an online service called UnlockJunky.com that claims to remove the FRP lock and previously linked account on your Android device within 5-15 minutes. This is a paid service that also claims that if they are unable to remove the lock, they will refund the amount to their customers.

So, if you cannot sign in **with a Google account that was previously synced**, you can give this, method a try.

**Step 1:** Open the official service page [Unlockjunky](https://unlockjunky.com/) on your browser.

**Step 2:** Next, choose the Vivo V27e device's brand, model, and unlock type from their respective drop-down menus. Click on Unlock Now button after entering the details.

**Step 3:** Now you need to initiate the order by providing the details asked and completing the payment.

**Step 4:** Next, the software needs to be downloaded and installed on your system, and using a USB cable, connect your phone to your computer.

**Step 5:** Connect with one of the support provider members through the live chat and they will help you remove the FRP lock on your Android phone.

With the steps above, you can remove the account **previously synced on this device**.

![bypass-frp-unlockjunkey](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/06/unlockjunky.jpg)

**Limitations of using the Unlockjunky method**:

- This is a paid service.
- Works only with Motorola, ZTE, and Samsung devices.
- There is no surety that the service will work for removing the FRP lock on your devices.
- If you have to remove the FRP lock from multiple devices, a separate payment for each device has to be done.
