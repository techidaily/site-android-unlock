This option wipes all user data and resets the phone to how you received it in the box.

**Step 3:** Tap Erase Everything.

## Method 4: Use Google Find My Device To Unlock Lava Blaze 2 5G  Phones (Wipes User Data)

Using Find My Device, you can play a sound on the Lava Blaze 2 5G device to locate it in the house if you have misplaced it, lock the phone in case it is lost, and wipe the Lava Blaze 2 5G device remotely.

**Step 1:** Go to <https://accounts.google.com>.

**Step 2:** Log in and go to Security > Your Devices:

![unlock motorola phone with google](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/09/full-guide-to-unlock-motorola-phones-10.jpg)
