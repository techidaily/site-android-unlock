## Method 1: Unlock Lenovo ThinkPhone  Phones Running Older Android OS (4.4 Or Below) With Google Security Questions

Up until Android version 4.4, you could lock your phone screen with a pattern. Google allowed you to unlock the phone by answering security questions in case you forgot the pattern.

**Step 1:** You may already have entered the incorrect pattern a few times. If so, simply tap the Forgot Pattern to start the process of unlocking your Lenovo ThinkPhone  phone screen. Else, deliberately enter incorrect pattern a few times till you see the Forgot Pattern option:

This option wipes all user data and resets the phone to how you received it in the box.

Overall, this method consumes a lot of time.

**Step 1:** Go to Settings > Backup & Reset.

**Step 2:** Tap Factory Reset > Reset Phone.

**Step 3:** Tap Erase Everything.

## Method 4: Use Google Find My Device To Unlock Lenovo ThinkPhone  Phones (Wipes User Data)

**Step 1:** Go to <https://accounts.google.com>.

**Step 2:** Log in and go to Security > Your Devices:
