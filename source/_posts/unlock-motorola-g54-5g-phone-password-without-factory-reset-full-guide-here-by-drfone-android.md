## Method 1: Unlock Motorola G54 5G  Phones Running Older Android OS (4.4 Or Below) With Google Security Questions

Up until Android version 4.4, you could lock your phone screen with a pattern. Google allowed you to unlock the phone by answering security questions in case you forgot the pattern.

So, if you have an old Motorola G54 5G  with Android 4.4 or earlier, here is **how to unlock Motorola G54 5G  phone password without factory reset**:

**Step 1:** You may already have entered the incorrect pattern a few times. If so, simply tap the Forgot Pattern to start the process of unlocking your Motorola G54 5G  phone screen. Else, deliberately enter incorrect pattern a few times till you see the Forgot Pattern option:

## Method 3: Factory Reset Motorola G54 5G  Phones (Wipes User Data)

Overall, this method consumes a lot of time.

**Step 1:** Go to Settings > Backup & Reset.

**Step 2:** Tap Factory Reset > Reset Phone.

**Step 3:** Tap Erase Everything.

## Part 1: What should I be aware of before resetting a Motorola G54 5G  Phone that is locked?

Before you go to reset your locked Motorola G54 5G  phone, it's crucial to learn about a few key factors. These factors will enable you to make a well-informed choice and help avoid potential complications during the factory reset process.

### 1\. Data Loss

Resetting your locked Motorola G54 5G  phone typically involves performing a factory reset. The process erases all data and settings on the Motorola G54 5G device. This includes your files, apps, contacts, and other information stored on the phone. You can easily restore these data if you have backed up data before. It's crucial to [back up essential data](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/android-backup-and-restore/) regularly to avoid data loss.

Failing to do so may lead to your device being locked. Understanding how to bypass or recover from FRP lock is essential if you find yourself in this situation.
