## Method 1: Unlock Oppo A59 5G  Phones Running Older Android OS (4.4 Or Below) With Google Security Questions

So, if you have an old Oppo A59 5G  with Android 4.4 or earlier, here is **how to unlock Oppo A59 5G  phone password without factory reset**:

**Step 1:** You may already have entered the incorrect pattern a few times. If so, simply tap the Forgot Pattern to start the process of unlocking your Oppo A59 5G  phone screen. Else, deliberately enter incorrect pattern a few times till you see the Forgot Pattern option:
