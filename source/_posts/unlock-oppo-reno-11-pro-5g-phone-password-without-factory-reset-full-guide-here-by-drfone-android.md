## Method 1: Unlock Oppo Reno 11 Pro 5G  Phones Running Older Android OS (4.4 Or Below) With Google Security Questions

Up until Android version 4.4, you could lock your phone screen with a pattern. Google allowed you to unlock the phone by answering security questions in case you forgot the pattern.

## Method 3: Factory Reset Oppo Reno 11 Pro 5G  Phones (Wipes User Data)

There is a standard factory reset built into every Oppo Reno 11 Pro 5G  phone to allow users to erase the Oppo Reno 11 Pro 5G device and start over fully.

Overall, this method consumes a lot of time.

**Step 1:** Go to Settings > Backup & Reset.

**Step 2:** Tap Factory Reset > Reset Phone.

**Step 3:** Tap Erase Everything.
