## Method 1: Unlock Vivo X Flip  Phones Running Older Android OS (4.4 Or Below) With Google Security Questions

Up until Android version 4.4, you could lock your phone screen with a pattern. Google allowed you to unlock the phone by answering security questions in case you forgot the pattern.

So, if you have an old Vivo X Flip  with Android 4.4 or earlier, here is **how to unlock Vivo X Flip  phone password without factory reset**:

**Step 1:** You may already have entered the incorrect pattern a few times. If so, simply tap the Forgot Pattern to start the process of unlocking your Vivo X Flip  phone screen. Else, deliberately enter incorrect pattern a few times till you see the Forgot Pattern option:

**Step 1:** Go to <https://accounts.google.com>.

You can request your service provider to unlock your Vivo X Flip  phone provided their conditions are met. Usually, they will be happy to oblige if there are no dues and the service period is over.

## Bonus Tip: If You Want To Disable Screen Lock

**Step 1:** Navigate to Settings > Security > Screen Lock.

**Step 2:** Enter the PIN or pattern.

**Step 3:** Choose None and confirm.

### Conclusion
