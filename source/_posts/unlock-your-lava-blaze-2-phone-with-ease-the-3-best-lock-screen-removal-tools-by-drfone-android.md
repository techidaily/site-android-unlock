## Method 3: Factory Reset Lava Blaze 2  Phones (Wipes User Data)

There is a standard factory reset built into every Lava Blaze 2  phone to allow users to erase the Lava Blaze 2 device and start over fully.

**Step 2:** Tap Factory Reset > Reset Phone.

**Step 3:** Tap Erase Everything.

## Method 4: Use Google Find My Device To Unlock Lava Blaze 2  Phones (Wipes User Data)

Using Find My Device, you can play a sound on the Lava Blaze 2 device to locate it in the house if you have misplaced it, lock the phone in case it is lost, and wipe the Lava Blaze 2 device remotely.

**Step 1:** Go to <https://accounts.google.com>.
