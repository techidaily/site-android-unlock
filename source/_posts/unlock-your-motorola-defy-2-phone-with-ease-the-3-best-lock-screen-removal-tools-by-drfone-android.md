After pressing the "Lock" button, a popup will appear, asking for a new password to replace the forgotten pin, pattern, or password.

## Method 3: Factory Reset Motorola Defy 2  Phones (Wipes User Data)

Overall, this method consumes a lot of time.

**Step 1:** Go to Settings > Backup & Reset.

**Step 2:** Tap Factory Reset > Reset Phone.

**Step 3:** Tap Erase Everything.
