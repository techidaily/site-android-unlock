Like most people, you probably lock your Oppo phone as soon as you turn it on. It's a good way to keep your phone safe from prying eyes and accidental button presses. But what happens when you forget your phone's passcode? Or worse, what if your phone gets locked by a malicious app?

There are a few different ways to unlock your Oppo phone. We'll show you how to do it.

## Method 1. Google Find My Device (Without Password/Pin/Pattern)

If you're like me, you've probably tried a million different ways to unlock your Oppo phone, only to be frustrated by the results. Luckily, there's an easy way to unlock your Oppo phone using Google's Find My Device feature.

Google will use your location, phone information, and connection log to find your Nokia.

Follow these steps to unlock the Oppo lock screen password without losing data:

- **Step 1**: Sign into your Google account and navigate the Find My Device website.

- **Step 2**: Sign in with your Google account, which you used on your locked Oppo phone.
- **Step 3**: The Android Device Manager dashboard will show your locked Oppo with three options: Ring, Lock, and Erase.
- **Step 4**: Simply click on "Lock".
- **Step 5**: Enter a password that is not your Google account password in the "New Password" field.
- **Step 6**: Type the new password in the "Confirm password" field. This password lock will replace the current lock screen.
- **Step 7**: You can leave the "Recovery message" field empty or type anything in it.
- **Step 8**: Enter another phone number in the "Phone number" field, although this is optional.
- **Step 9**: Choose "Lock" after entering your password and filling out the optional fields if you wish.
- **Step 10**: If the process is successful, you will receive the unlock code within a few seconds.
- **Step 11**: Navigate to the "Screen Settings" menu after unlocking your device.
- **Step 12**: Use a new password; you can use the temporary password if you want.

You can use it to unlock your Oppo if you have activated the Android Device Manager or Google Find My Device before your phone was locked.

## Method 2. Unlock Oppo Lock Screen With Hard Reset

If you perform a hard reset on your Oppo lock screen, all data, and user information will be erased, including your screen lock, password, pattern lock, and PIN.

Follow the steps below if you want to know how to unlock the Oppo phone keypad with the hard reset, follow the steps below.

- **Step 1**: Turn off your Oppo phone.
- **Step 2**: Press the “Volume down” and “Power key” buttons simultaneously for a few seconds.
- **Step 3**: Press the “Volume Up” and “Power” buttons for a few additional seconds once the screen darkens.
- **Step 4**: Release all buttons and keys if you did step 3 correctly. Once you release all buttons, you'll see a dark screen with options.
- **Step 5**: Choose "Wipe data/factory reset" from the menu, using “Volume Up” to scroll up, “Volume Down” to scroll down, and “Power” to select.
- **Step 6**: From the Android Recovery screen, select the “Yes” option by pressing the “Volume Down” button and the “Power” key.
- **Step 7**: With the “Power” key, select "Reboot system now" from the next display.

Your Oppo is now password, pattern lock, screen lock, and PIN-free after a hard reset.

## Method 3. Unlock With Answer Security Questions

## Method 4. Unlock the Keypad With a Security Code

You could reset your Oppo lock screen phone using the default security code, even if you haven't set any security code. Here's how to quickly unlock the Oppo lock screen security code.

- **Step 1**: Shut down your device.
- **Step 2**: Press these buttons in the following sequence on a classic phone.
