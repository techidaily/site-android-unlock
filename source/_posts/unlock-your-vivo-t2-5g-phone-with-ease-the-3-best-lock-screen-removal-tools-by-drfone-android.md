## Part 1: Show Wifi Password on Rooted Android Device

### What is Rooting?

First of all, what does rooting mean? You have probably used a Windows computer or even Linux. For the case of Windows, when installing a new program or software, it always prompts a dialog box saying, "Administrator permission required to run this program." If you don't have the administrator permission, you won't install the program. In Android, this is called rooting. In simple terms, it means having the root permission to your phone. Some Android apps will require you the root permission, e.g., flashing your ROM. In this part, we will explain how you can show the Wi-Fi password on your Android with root.

To find the Wi-Fi passwords on your Android phone, you need to have an app to explore files which also supports a root user. In this case, ES FileExplorer or Root Explorer will come in handy. However, it turns out that the latter is offered at $3. Let's use the free ES File Explorer.

![android show wifi password](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14556294042257.jpg)

As you can see above, we have found the Wi-Fi passwords on the android device. On each network profile, we have the name of the network represented by _name (ssid="{the name}")_, the network's password represented by _psk_, the network's access point represented by _key\_mgmt=WPA-PSK_ and its priority represented by _priority_.

## Part 2: Show Wifi Password on Android without Root

What if I don't have root access to my Android, can I still see Android Wi-Fi password? The short answer is yes. However, this is a bit involving but simple. You don't need to be a computer guru to do it, but you need to have a computer and some internet access of course. The key thing is to find a way through which we can fetch the password file from the phone without using a root access protocol in the Android. This is made possible by some little programming insight using the Windows Command prompt.

### Steps to show Wi-Fi password on Android without root

Step 1: Access the Developer authority

To access the files that Android uses to run passwords, you must first become a developer. This is very simple.

Get your Android phone and go to settings. Scroll down and find "About phone." Tap on it and scroll down again to find Build number.

![android show wifi password](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14556302638925.jpg)

Tap on this "build number" 5 to 6 times until a message pops up, saying, "You are now a developer".

![android show wifi password](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14556303263992.jpg)

Step 2: Enable the debugging.

Go back to Settings. Scroll down for developer options. Turn on the button for "Android/USB debugging".

![android show wifi password](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14556308665697.jpg)

Step 3: Install ADB drivers.

Now, open your Windows desktop. Download and install ADB drivers. (Use this download link [adbdriver.com](http://adbdriver.com/)). You need to download and install platform tools (minimal ADB and fastboot) from [http://forum.xda-developers.com/...](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2317790) Now open the folder where you've installed the above tools. By default, it is in the Local disc _C\\windows\\system32\\platform\_tools_ location. However, you might want to locate them by searching on the windows search engine. You have to hold the Shift key and right-click inside the folder to click on"Open Command Window Here."

![android show wifi password](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14556329561742.jpg)

Step 4: Test the ADB

Here, we would like to test whether the ABD is working properly. To do this, connect your phone to the PC using a USB. In the command prompt, type **adb services** and then press enter. If it's working properly, you should see a device on this list.

![android show wifi password](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14556329984622.jpg)

Step 5: Find the Android wifi password.

Now, it is time to type the given command in the command prompt and type: _adb pull /data/misc/wifi/wpa\_supplicant.conf c:/wpa\_supplicant.conf_. This will fetch the file from your phone to the local disc C drive of the PC.

Step 6: Get the wifi passwords.

Lastly, open the file with a notepad, and there you go.

## Part 3: Other ways to Unlock Pattern for Android

There are other ways to unlock the **universal unlock patterns** for Android. We have mentioned some of them below.

### Way 1: Remove Gesture File Using ADB

The first method is ADB, which stands for Android Debug Bridge. With the help of this, you can unlock your Android's **[universal unlock pattern](https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/unlock-iphone-without-passcode.html)** without the need of a factory reset. However, the process may seem a bit time-consuming to you. Here is how you can do it.

**Step 1**: Open your PC and head to [Android Developer's site](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb.html). Download ADB now.

**Step 2**: Launch it now and install the packages on your PC.

### Way 2: Boot into Safe Mode to Bypass Third-Party App Screen Lock

It's one of the most straightforward ways to get past the lock screen. One thing to note is that this method is effective only if the lock screen is a third-party app rather than the standard one.

**Step 1**: Firstly, long-press the Power button to get the power menu.

**Step 2**: Now, long tap the "Power Off" button and click "OK" when shown the pop-up.

![unlock android screen 11](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/12/safe-mode-1.jpg)

**Step 3**: This will restart your device in safe mode.

**Step 4**: This will turn off the third-party lock screen for the time being. Clear the lock screen app's data, uninstall it, and then reboot to exit safe mode.

### Way 3: Unlock Pattern Lock via Factory Reset

This should only be a last option because it will completely delete your device's data and saved settings. Your device will be reset to factory settings, meaning your device's settings will get back to the same as when you first bought it. If you want to learn how to [unlock a pattern](https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/samsung-unlock-codes.html) by doing a factory reset, follow these steps:

**Step 1**: Long press the Home, Power and Volume Up keys to Recovery Mode.

Please note that the Recovery mode method may vary from device to device. So please ensure to check the key combination before you do it.

**Step 2**: Now go to the "wipe data/factory reset" option using the volume keys. To confirm it, press the Power key.

![unlock android screen 15](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/12/android-device-manager-1.jpg)

There are a few things to keep in mind as you use this service to get around the lock screen. If the Android device is compatible, the Android Device Manager will connect it after a few tries. After it has been connected to the Vivo T2 5G device, we can begin by pressing the "Lock" button.

After pressing the "Lock" button, a popup will appear, asking for a new password to replace the forgotten pin, pattern, or password.

![unlock android screen 16](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/12/android-device-manager-2.jpg)

Type the new password once, then confirm it by typing it again. This will change the password in a few minutes and the new password can be used to unlock the Vivo T2 5G device.

**Step 1**: Simply enter wrong pattern too many times until try again in 30 seconds warning comes.

**Step 2**: Select the "Forgot Pattern" option below the message.
