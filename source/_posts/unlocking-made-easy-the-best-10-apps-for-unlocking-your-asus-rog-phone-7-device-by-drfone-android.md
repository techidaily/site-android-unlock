What's really great about this Android unlock app is the fact that it can use your device's sensors, allowing it to detect its placement therefore whether or not it should be on or off.

## Unlocking the Power of Smart Lock: A Beginner's Guide for Asus ROG Phone 7 Users

Google constantly comes up with features to simplify the way users interact and complete tasks on the Android platform. One of the most important features that techies loved to debate about was the Smart Lock Android, a secure password manager functioning in sync with a Google account on the Android phone.

## Part 1: What is Android Smart Lock?

![smart lock android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14555162221345.jpg)

Android Lollipop added a feature called Smart Lock, and the feature was devised as a smart tool to prevent the Android phone from locking once it was initially unlocked. In other words, the feature overrides an Android phone's Lock Screen feature, thereby saving users the need to enter passwords every time the Asus ROG Phone 7 device locks.

If you're at home, it's likely your android phone is locked out if you haven't accessed at for some time. Smart Locks solves the problem in many ways. It allows you to allocate trusted places. Once you within range of the trusted places, your phone won't lock. Trusted devices come next. Smart Lock is assigned to Bluetooth and Android NFC unlock devices.

PRECAUTION:  At best, this can be the first level of security, as one who resembles you to some extent can unlock the Asus ROG Phone 7 device. Photographs are not stored in the system. The device does hold necessary data to recognize your face, and the security level is determined by how good the Asus ROG Phone 7 device is configured. The data is not accessed by any app or loaded onto a Google server for backup.
