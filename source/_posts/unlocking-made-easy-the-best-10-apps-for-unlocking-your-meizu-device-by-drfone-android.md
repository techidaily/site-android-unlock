## 7.Next Lock Screen

Next Lock Screen is a cross platform unlock app that's compatible with the complete Android ecosystem, making it one of the most valuable unlock apps for Android on the market.

## 8.AcDisplay

AcDisplay comes with a rather minimalistic look similar to some of the most popular web site creator services like Squarespace or Wix. The home screen will highlight notifications for which it will offer two options, either you swipe down in which case you will ignore the notification, or swipe anywhere else and the lock screen will unlock. What's really great about this Android unlock app is the fact that it can use your device's sensors, allowing it to detect its placement therefore whether or not it should be on or off.

## 9.C Locker Pro

It would be unjust to call it an Android unlock app, this application is actually a carefully selected package that allows you to do a lot of cools stuff with your new and improved home screen.
