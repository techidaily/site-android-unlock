## Part 1: What Is Android Pattern?

A **pattern lock** is used to identify the actual user by your Android phone. It is a widely used phone locking system and a secured one. Simply put, a pattern lock includes a line pattern you choose that you can draw to unlock a lock screen. You can enable this lock screen feature from the security menu in the settings application.

So, if you have set a **pattern lock** as a screen lock for your device, you will need to draw the exact pattern every time you log in.

## Part 2: Best Tool to Unlock Your Pattern

### Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock

The most effective and quick tool to unlock a **pattern lock** is Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock by Wondershare. Dr.Fone is an all-in-one tool for all your Android needs and has been in the business for a long time. We suggest you use Dr.Fone. The following steps will help you unlock your device:

**Step 1.** Select the "Screen Unlock" option in the Dr.Fone interface.

![screen unlock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png)

**Step 2. Select Unlock Android Screen**

To unlock the pattern lock on your device, the “Unlock Android Screen” will guide you to finish the whole process.

![select unlock android screen](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/android-screen-unlock-3.png)

**Step 3. Select unlock mode**

If you click “Remove without Data Loss,” only some limited Samsung or LG phone models can be unlocked without losing data. To unlock most phone brands' screens, “100% Remove Screen Lock” is a better choice.

- Connect your device to your PC using a USB connector.
- On your PC, open a terminal window (or command prompt).
- Type in the commands given below. Press Enter after each line:

adb shell

album/data/data/com.android.providers.settings/databases
