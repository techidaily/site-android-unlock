## Unlocking the Power of Smart Lock: A Beginner's Guide for Lava Yuva 3 Pro Users

Google constantly comes up with features to simplify the way users interact and complete tasks on the Android platform. One of the most important features that techies loved to debate about was the Smart Lock Android, a secure password manager functioning in sync with a Google account on the Android phone.

## Part 1: What is Android Smart Lock?

![smart lock android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14555162221345.jpg)

Android Lollipop added a feature called Smart Lock, and the feature was devised as a smart tool to prevent the Android phone from locking once it was initially unlocked. In other words, the feature overrides an Android phone's Lock Screen feature, thereby saving users the need to enter passwords every time the Lava Yuva 3 Pro device locks.

If you're at home, it's likely your android phone is locked out if you haven't accessed at for some time. Smart Locks solves the problem in many ways. It allows you to allocate trusted places. Once you within range of the trusted places, your phone won't lock. Trusted devices come next. Smart Lock is assigned to Bluetooth and Android NFC unlock devices.

![smart lock android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14555162911081.jpg)

![smart lock android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14555165271526.jpg)

Finally, trusted face unlocking is the ultimate face recognition system that unlocks your Android device as soon as you look at it across the front-facing camera. A face unlock first introduced with Android Jelly Bean and has been significantly improved in later versions.

_Turning On Smart Lock_

The feature is enabled by first accessing settings. For example, in a Samsung Galaxy S6:

Tap on Settings, which is the gear symbol.

![smart lock android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14555171833750.jpg)

- • Click on Personal and tap on Security.
- • Go to Advanced and tap on Trust agents and make sure Smart Lock is turned on.

![smart lock android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14555174399892.jpg)

- • Under Screen Security tap Smart Lock.
- • Here, you need to enter your Screen Lock. If you haven't done so, set up a password and PIN by following the on-screen prompts. The screen Lock is needed every time you have to change the Smart Lock settings.

![smart lock android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14555175242280.jpg)

Within Smart Lock, there are three options for setting the system. You can set up trusted devices, trusted face, and trusted places individually, combining two or all three at the same time. You can choose just one trusted face, but you have the option to set up as many trusted devices and trusted places as needed.

![smart lock android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14555176091774.jpg)

## Part 2: Turn On Smart Lock For Android with Trusted Devices

You can decide on a trusted device to be paired with Smart Lock Android.

![smart lock android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14555177245258.jpg)

For example, you can set up a Smart Lock for Bluetooth in your Android Bluetooth settings. It can also be done for Android NFC unlock devices. Examples include the Bluetooth system in your car, NFC unlocks, android sticker on the car's phone dock, or Bluetooth in your watch.

- • Go to Settings.
- • Tap on Security and then Smart Lock.
- • Existing paired options are listed under Trusted Devices.
- • Initially, trusted devices will show None.

![smart lock android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14555179612746.jpg)

Tap on Add Trusted Devices.

![smart lock android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14555180455802.jpg)

The next screen is the Choose Device Type.

![smart lock android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14555181196889.jpg)

Since you have already paired Bluetooth, it will ask you to choose the Lava Yuva 3 Pro device from the list.

![smart lock android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14555182031784.jpg)

- • As an example, let's take the case of LG HBS800. It may show Not connected until you add it.
- • It will show up under Trusted devices in the Smart Lock menu.
- • When you turn the added device on, Smart Lock now unlocks the Android mobile.

![smart lock android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14555183103300.jpg)

Similarly, other Bluetooth and NFC unlock android supported gadgets can be added under the list of Trusted Devices.
